## Experience Data Model (XDM) and XDM System

Standardization and interoperability are key concepts behind Experience Platform. Experience Data Model (XDM), driven by Adobe, is an effort to standardize customer experience data and define schemas for customer experience management.

XDM is a publicly documented specification designed to improve the power of digital experiences. It provides common structures and definitions for any application to communicate with services on Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation delivering insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

XDM is the mechanism that allows Experience Cloud, powered by Adobe Experience Platform, to deliver the right message to the right person, on the right channel, at exactly the right moment.

The methodology on which Experience Platform is built, XDM System operationalizes Experience Data Model schemas for use by Experience Platform components.

**New features**

| Feature    | Description  |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| JSON Schema constraints  | The following datatypes now have additional options in the user interface to define constraints: <ul><li>`string` - min/max length, pattern, default value, formats (as defined in [JSON Schema draft-6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-01))</li><li>`double` - min/max, default value</li></ul> |
| Custom `$id`  | You can now provide your own `$id` value when creating resources in POST requests. |
| Schema Registry performance improvements  | Optimized union schema generation, and enhanced schema caching to greatly improve API response times. |

**Fixes**

* Moved the identityMap field out of context/profile and into its own mixin to make defining identities more intuitive.
* Patched all existing schemas based on context/profile with context/identitymap.
* Fixed error message when no version is supplied.
* Fixed bug where Schema Registry was giving random responses for profile union schema calls.
* Fixed bug where union schemas were not displaying the correct fields in Schema Registry.
* Fixed bug where identity descriptors were occasionally not able to be created with valid namespaces.
* Fixed dereference issue if an object uses `properties` instead of `allOf`.

**Known issues**

* Cannot extend a Platform-supplied mixin by adding a field.
* Descriptors are not deleted when a mixin is removed from the schema composition.
* Unable to create an enum field with no labels.

To learn more about working with XDM using the Schema Registry API and Schema Editor, please read the [XDM System documentation](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/xdm.html).


## Profile, Identity, and Segmentation

## Query Service

Query Service provides the ability to use standard SQL to query data in Adobe Experience Platform to support many different analysis and data management use cases. It is a serverless tool which allows you to join any datasets in Experience Data Lake and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Profile Service.

You can use Query Service to build data analysis ecosystems, creating a picture of consumers across their various interaction channels. These channels might include:

* Point-of-sale system
* Web
* Mobile
* CRM system

**Key features**

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Query Editor | Use a web-based tool to write, validate, test, and execute queries. It includes a console for detailed information on the execution of queries, as well as the ability to preview query results. | 
| Dataset Creation | Create datasets on Experience Platform via standard SQL syntax. |
| Adobe-Defined Functions | Leverage shortcut functions for common tasks like identifying sessions or setting attribution. |
| BI Tool Connectivity | Use the Postgres drivers found in common BI tools to connect to Query Service to create reports and visualizations. Supported tools include: Tableau, Power BI, and Looker. Find authentication information on the Credentials tab. |
| Database Management Tool Connectivity | Connect Aqua Data Studio or DB visualizer to Query Service for data exploration and dataset creation functionality. Query Service also supports connectivity from R Studio. Find authentication information on the Credentials tab. |
| Command Line Query Tool | Connect PSQL to be able to run queries from the command line. |
| Query Log  | Keeps a history of queries executed by Query Service and enables you to find prior SQL for editing, execution, or for creating a dataset out of the results. |
| Query Scheduling API  | Schedule queries for recurring execution via this API. |

**Known issues**

* Query Editor shows a sample of 100 rows of the results for your queries. In order to persist the complete result set, use the dataset creation capabilities from the Query Log. 
* Near-term releases will add support for Views and a UI for applying schedules to queries. 

For more information about Query Service, see the [product documentation](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/services/query-service/query-service.html).
