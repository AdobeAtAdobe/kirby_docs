## Profile, Identity, and Segmentation {#profile-identity-segmentation}

New features and fixes in Profile, Identity, and Segmentation:

* [Profile](#profile)
* [Identity](#identity)
* [Segmentation](#segmentation)

### Profile {#profile}

Unified Profile is a generic lookup entity store that merges data across various enterprise data assets and provides access to that data in the form of unified real-time consumer profiles, and related time series events, called the union view. The unified view helps to inform and empower actions across channels, Platform, and Adobe solution integrations. Furthermore, Unified Profile is used to power machine learning & Sensei. Unified Profile APIs can also be used directly to enrich the functionality of third-party solutions, CRMs, and proprietary solutions.

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Real-time customer profile  | Unified Profile ingests data delivered in real time via data inlets, merges it with existing data in the profile store, and creates or modifies the unified view at near real time. This data, evolving in time with your customers' experience, can be used to make personalized recommendations. |
| Union view | One of the key features of Unified Profile is the ability to unify multi-channel data. Unified Profile can supply you with a merged view of the individuals in your consumer base, across datasets and for linked identities, referred to as the union view. |
| Edge | Edge Service serves as a framework for low-latency data collection, pluggable computing and rapid data activation across all addressable channels. Edge Service facilitates for real-time personalization. |

**Known issues**

None.

For product documentation, see [Unified Profile Overview](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/profile-identity-segmentation/profile-identity-segmentation-services.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/unified_profile_architectural_overview/unified_profile_architectural_overview.md).

### Identity {#identity}

Identity Service solves the fundamental challenge posed by the disconnected identities of your customers caused by the fragmented nature of their data as it exists across each of the disparate systems at play in your organization's ecosystem. It does this by bridging identities across devices and across the various systems used by your consumers to engage with your brand. In this way, Identity Service facilitates a complete understanding of your customers and their behavior so you can deliver impactful digital experiences in real-time.

Identity 

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Identity graph  | An identity graph is a map of relationships between identities that updates with customer activity in near real time. Identity Service manages an identity graph visible by only your organization and built based on your data, referred to as the private graph. Identity Service augments your private graph when a record of ingested data contains more than one identity, adding a relationship between the identities found. |

**Known issues**

None.

For product documentation, see [Identity Service Overview](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/profile-identity-segmentation/profile-identity-segmentation-services.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/identity_services_architectural_overview/identity_services_architectural_overview.md).

## Data Governance {#data-governance}

### Data Usage Labeling and Enforcement (DULE) {#dule}

Segmentation deals with defining a particular subset of profiles from your profile store, or more specifically to describe the criteria distinguishing a marketable group of people among your profile store. Segments can be based on record data (such as demographic information) or time series events representing customer touch points with your brand.

For example, in an email campaign called 'Did you forget to buy your sneakers?', you may want an audience segment of all users who searched for running shoes within the last 30 days, but who did not complete a purchase. Or, you may want to target web content to display only for users with a certain rating in your rewards program.

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Segmentation API  | RESTful services give you programmatic access to build customer segments. |
| Segment Builder  | The segment builder is a robust and intuitive workspace for building customer segments from your Profile data. |

**Known issues**

None.

For product documentation, see [Segment Builder Overview](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/profile-identity-segmentation/profile-identity-segmentation-services.html#!end-user/markdown/segmentation_overview/segmentation.md) for building segments using the Platform UI, or [Creating segments via API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/tutorials/alltutorials.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/tutorials/creating_a_segment_tutorial/creating_a_segment_tutorial.md) for instructions on building segments using the API.
