# Adobe Analytics Field Mapping to ExperienceEvent XDM

Adobe Analytics report suites are published to Adobe Experience Platform as two separate datasets. These are referred to as postvalues and midvalues. The postvalues dataset reflects the data as it's used in Analysis Workspace and the midvalues reflect the data as collected after being transformed by processing rules and VISTA without the commerce or visitor profile processing. The midvalues dataset makes it possible for the Query Service's Adobe Defined Functions (ADFs) customize the sessionization and attribution applied to reporting. Both datasets are pre-filtered to exclude the standard bot traffic and rows flagged as excluded from reporting in Analytics. The midvalues dataset is also streamed to the Adobe Experience Platform to support near-real-time use cases of Unified Profile.
