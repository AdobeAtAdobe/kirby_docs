# Running queries
Query Service provides the power to run SQL queries against datasets in Experience Data Lake. There are a few things to be aware of as you use SQL to interact with datasets in a data lake. The Query Service manages certain things, like creating SQL-safe table names for each dataset in the data lake. There are also considerations around working with the hierarchical data in the data lake: discovering schema, selecting just the right field in the hierarchical model are two important concepts. 

Follow the exercises in this section to get a good idea for how the Query Service works.
