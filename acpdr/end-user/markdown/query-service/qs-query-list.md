# Query List Page

You can retrieve authentication information and connect to your instance of the Query Service to see what datasets are available and issue queries. The Adobe Experience Platform UI shows a list of queries that you've run. The query list provides the following information:

*   Query name
    
    Hover over the query name to see more information about the query. If you've named the query, you'll see the name and the SQL. If you haven't named the query, for example if you created the query in another tool, you won't see that information.
    
*   The person who created the query
*   Client used for the query
*   The datasets used in the query
*   The status of the query
*   The date and time when the query was run
*   How long it took to run the query

You can also use the Queries screen to [connect BI tools](qs-external-query-credentials.md) or create a new query (not available for Alpha).

If a query will take longer to run than the length of your session, a message displays giving you a URL where you can see and run the query, and generate a result set you can use later.
