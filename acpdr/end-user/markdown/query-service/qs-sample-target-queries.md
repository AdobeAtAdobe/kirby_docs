# Sample Queries for Adobe Target Data

Data from Adobe Target is transformed into Experience Event XDM schema and ingested into Experience Platform as datasets for you. There are many use cases for Query Service with this Data, and the following sample queries should work with your Adobe Target datasets.

A note about the following examples: you will need to edit the SQL to fill in the expected parameters for your queries based on the dataset, variables, or timeframe you are interested in evaluating. You will need to provide parameters wherever you see { } in the SQL.

## Standard dataset name for Target data source on Platform: 

Adobe Target Experience Events (friendly name) <br>
adobe_target_experience_events (name to use in query)

## High-level partial XDM Field Mapping

The use of [ ] denotes an array 

| Name | XDM Field | Notes |
| ---- | --------- | ----- |
| mboxName | _experience.target.mboxname
| Activity ID | _experience.target.activities.activityID
| Experience ID	| _experience.target.activities[].activityEvents[]._experience.target.activity.activityevent.context.experienceID
| Segment ID | _experience.target.activities[].activityEvents[].segmentEvents[].segmentID._id
| Event Scope | _experience.target.activities[].activityEvents[].eventScope | Tracks new Visitor and Visit
| Step ID | _experience.target.activities[].activityEvents[]._experience.target.activity.activityevent.context.stepID | Custom step ID for Campaign
| Price Total | commerce.order.priceTotal	|
