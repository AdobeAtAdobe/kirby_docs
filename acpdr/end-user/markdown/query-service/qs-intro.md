# What Is Experience Query Service?

Experience Query Service gives you the ability to use standard SQL to query data in Adobe Experience Platform to support many different use cases. It is a serverless tool which allows you to join any datasets in Experience Data Lake and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Profile Service. 

You can use Query Service to build data analysis ecosystems, creating a picture of consumers across their various interaction channels. These channels might include:

*   Point-of-sale system
*   Web
*   Mobile
*   CRM system

## Key Use Case Examples
* Joins of Experience Event datasets with other customer data to create reporting or BI inputs
* Customer Journey reporting
* Omni-channel attribution
* Data collection debugging


Query Service serves as a consolidated reporting SQL interface for solutions across Experience Cloud and other datasets loaded into Adobe Experience Platform. In its current implementation, the Query Service provides:

*   A Query List UI to see all of the queries that have been run in your organization.
*   The ability to connect external query clients.
*   The ability to create datasets in Experience Data Lake from query output.
*   An HTTP API for issuing queries.
