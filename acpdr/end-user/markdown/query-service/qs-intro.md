# What is Query Service?

Query Service gives you the ability to use standard SQL to query data in Adobe Experience Platform, supporting many different use cases. It is a serverless tool that allows you to join any datasets in Experience Data Lake and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Profile Service. 

You can use Query Service to build data analysis ecosystems, creating a picture of consumers across their various interaction channels. These channels might include:

* Point-of-sale system
* Web
* Mobile
* CRM system

## Key use case examples
* Joins of Experience Event datasets with other customer data to create reporting or BI inputs
* Customer Journey reporting
* Omni-channel attribution
* Data collection debugging

Query Service serves as a consolidated reporting SQL interface for solutions across Experience Cloud and other datasets loaded into Adobe Experience Platform. In its current implementation, Query Service provides:

* A Query List UI to see all of the queries that have been run in your organization.
* The ability to connect external query clients.
* The ability to create datasets in Experience Data Lake from query output.
* An HTTP API for issuing queries.
