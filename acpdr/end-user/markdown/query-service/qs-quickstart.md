# Quick Start Guide
1. In order to use Query Service, your organization needs to be provisioned for Adobe Experience Platform and your adminstrator needs to grant you access to it. 
2. If you haven't already ingested your data into Adobe Experience Platform, then that is where you should start. Here you can find [data ingestion documentation](https://stage.adobe.io/apis/cloudplatform/dataservices/data-ingestion.html).
3. Experience Query Service provides a way to connect external tools to issue queries. Here are instructions on connecting a tool such as a Business Intelligence tool or a command line interface. [Connect a tool.](qs-connect.md)
4. Once you have an external tool connected, you can [write and run queries.](qs-queries.md)
