# Query Service

Customers want to build comprehensive data analysis ecosystems.

Use the Query Service to create a picture of consumers across their various interaction channels. These channels might include:

*   Point-of-sale system
*   Website
*   CRM system

Query Service helps you collect all that data in one place and answer questions about that data.

Traditionally, Analytics customers have taken their Analytics data and fed it through Hadoup or some other proprietary data warehousing system, or moved it into Google Cloud Platform, then ingested other datasets and started their analysis. Once they've generated their insights, they have to get them back into the Experience Cloud.

The Adobe Platform Query Service closes that loop. It provides a general-purpose SQL interface for datasets that exist in the data lake.

The Query Service will eventually replace Analytics Data Warehouse. It will also serve as a consolidated reporting SQL interface for solution use cases.

In its current implementation, Query Service provides:

*   Basic structure
*   Query service itself
*   SQL interface to make it possible to generate queries
*   Integration pathways for external tools to connect and issue queries
