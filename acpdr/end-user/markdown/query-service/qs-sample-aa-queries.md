# Sample queries for Adobe Analytics data

Data from selected Adobe Analytics report suites is transformed into XDM ExperienceEvents and ingested into Adobe Experience Platform as datasets for you. There are many use cases for Adobe Experience Platform Query Service with this data, and the following sample queries should work with your Adobe Analytics datasets. Information on where your Analytics fields land in XDM ExperienceEvents can be [found here](solutionref/analytics-field-map.md).

## Getting started

The SQL examples throughout this document require you to edit the SQL and fill in the expected parameters for your queries based on the dataset, eVar, event, or timeframe you are interested in evaluating. Provide parameters wherever you see `{ }` in the SQL examples that follow.

Also, note whether the sample SQL calls for `post_values`. If it does, then you need to use a table that represents a dataset with post values in it. Datasets have tablenames that tell you if they are mid or post values. If the sample query does not specify, you can use either. 

## Commonly used SQL examples

## Merchandising variables (product syntax)

In Adobe Analytics, custom product-level data can be collected through specially configured variables called "Merchandising Variables." These are based on either an eVar or Custom Event. The difference between these variables and their standard use is that they represent a separate value for each product found on the hit rather than only a single value for the hit. These variables are referred to as Product Syntax Merchandising Variables. 

This allows for collection of information like a per product "discount amount" or information about the product's "location on page" in the customer's search results.

Here are the XDM fields to access the merchandising variables in your Analytics dataset:

### eVars

```
productListItems[#]._experience.analytics.customDimensions.evars.evar#
```

Where `[#]` is an array index and `evar#` is the specific eVar variable.

### Custom events

```
productListItems[#]._experience.analytics.event1to100.event#.value
```

Where `[#]` is an array index and `event#` is the specific custom event variable.

### Sample queries

Here is a sample query returning a merchandising eVar and event for the first product found in the `productListItems`.

```sql
SELECT
  productListItems[0]._experience.analytics.customDimensions.evars.eVar1,
  productListItems[0]._experience.analytics.event1to100.event1.value
FROM adobe_analytics_midvalues
WHERE _ACP_YEAR=2019 AND _ACP_MONTH=7 AND _ACP_DAY=23
  AND productListItems[0].SKU IS NOT NULL
  AND productListItems[0]._experience.analytics.customDimensions.evars.eVar1 IS NOT NULL
  AND productListItems[0]._experience.analytics.event1to100.event1.value IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10
```

This next query 'explodes' the `productListItems` and returns each merchandising eVar and event per product. The `_id` field is included to show the relationship to the original hit. The `_id` value is a unique primary key in the ExperienceEvent dataset.

```sql
SELECT
  _id,
  productItem._experience.analytics.customDimensions.evars.eVar1,
  productItem._experience.analytics.event1to100.event1.value
FROM (
  SELECT
    _id,
    explode(productListItems) as productItem
  FROM adobe_analytics_midvalues
  WHERE _ACP_YEAR=2019 AND _ACP_MONTH=7 AND _ACP_DAY=23
  AND productListItems[0].SKU IS NOT NULL
  AND productListItems[0]._experience.analytics.customDimensions.evars.eVar1 IS NOT NULL
  AND productListItems[0]._experience.analytics.event1to100.event1.value IS NOT NULL
)
LIMIT 20
```

### Common error when implementing the sample queries

The "No such struct field" error is encountered when you attempt to retrieve a field that doesn't existing in your current dataset. Evaluate the reason returned in the error message to identify an available field then update your query and rerun.

```
ERROR: ErrorCode: 08P01 sessionId: XXXX queryId: XXXX Unknown error encountered. Reason: [No such struct field evar1 in eVar10, eVar13, eVar62, eVar88, eVar2;]
```
## Merchandising variables (conversion syntax)

Another type of a Merchandising Variable found in Adobe Analytics is Conversion Syntax. With Product Syntax the value is collected at the same time as the product but this requires the data to be present on the same page. There are scenarios where the data occurs on a page prior to the conversion or event of interest related to the product. For example, consider the Product Finding Method reporting use case.

1. A user performs and internal search for "winter hat" which sets the Conversion Syntax enabled Merchandising eVar6 to "internal search:winter hat"
2. The user clicks on "waffle beanie" and lands on the product detail page.  
  a. Landing here fires off a `Product View` event for the "waffle beanie" for $12.99.  
  b. Because `Product View` is configured as a binding event the product "waffle beanie" is now bound to the eVar6 value of "internal search:winter hat". Anytime the "waffle beanie" product is collected it will be associated to "internal search:winter hat" until either (1) the expiration setting is reached or (2) a new eVar6 value is set and the binding event occurs with that product again.
3. The user adds the product to their cart, firing the `Cart Add` event.
4. The user performs another internal search for "summer shirt" which sets the Conversion Syntax enabled Merchandising eVar6 to "internal search:summer shirt"
5. The user click on "sporty t-shirt" and lands on the product detail page.  
  a. Landing here fires off a `Product View` event for "sporty t-shirt for $19.99.  
  b. The `Product View` event is still our binding event so now the product "sporty t-shirt" is now bound to the eVar6 value of "internal search:summer shirt" and the prior product "waffle beanie" is still bound to an eVar6 value of "internal search:waffle beanie".
6. The user adds the product to their cart, firing the `Cart Add` event.
7. The user checks out with both products.

In reporting, the orders, revenue, product views, and cart adds will be reportable against eVar6 and will align to the activity of the bound product.

| eVar6 (Product Finding Method) | revenue | orders | product views | cart adds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|internal search:summer shirt	|19.99	|1|	1|	1|
|internal search:winter hat|	12.99|	1|	1|	1|

Here are the XDM fields to produce the Conversion Syntax in your Analytics dataset:

### eVars

```
_experience.analytics.customDimensions.evars.evar#
```

Where `evar#` is the specific eVar variable.

### Product

```
productListItems[#].sku
```

Where `[#]` is an array index.

### Sample queries

Here is a sample query binding the value to the specific product and event pair, in this case the product view event.

```sql
SELECT
  endUserIds._experience.aaid.id AS AAID,
  timestamp,
  CASE WHEN commerce.productViews.value = 1 THEN ATTRIBUTION_LAST_TOUCH(timestamp, 'bindConversionSyntaxMerchVariable_eVar1', _experience.analytics.customDimensions.eVars.eVar1)
  OVER(PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.aaid.id
       ORDER BY timestamp
       ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW).value
  END AS eVar1Bind,
  EXPLODE(productListItems) AS Product_List,
  commerce.productViews.value AS prodView,
  commerce.purchases.value AS purchase
FROM adobe_analytics_midvalues
WHERE commerce.productViews.value = 1 OR commerce.purchases.value = 1 OR _experience.analytics.customDimensions.eVars.eVar1 IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100
```

Here is a sample query persisting the bound value to subsequent occurrences of the respective product. The lowest sub-query establishes the values relationship with the product on the declared binding event. The next sub-query performs the attribution of that bound value across subsequent interactions with the respective product. And the top level select aggregates the results to produce the reporting.

```sql
SELECT
  Product_List.SKU,
  eVar1101ConversionSyntax,
  SUM(prodView) AS Product_Views,
  SUM(purchase) AS Purchases
FROM
(
  SELECT
    Product_List,
    ATTRIBUTION_LAST_TOUCH(timestamp, 'ConversionSyntax_eVar1', eVar1Bind)
      OVER(PARTITION BY AAID, Product_List.SKU
           ORDER BY timestamp
           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW).value
    AS eVar1ConversionSyntax,
    prodView,
    purchase
  FROM
  (
    SELECT
      endUserIds._experience.aaid.id AS AAID,
      timestamp,
      CASE WHEN commerce.productViews.value = 1 THEN ATTRIBUTION_LAST_TOUCH(timestamp, 'bindConversionSyntaxMerchVariable_eVar1', _experience.analytics.customDimensions.eVars.eVar1)
      OVER(PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.aaid.id
           ORDER BY timestamp
           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW).value
      END AS eVar1Bind,
      EXPLODE(productListItems) AS Product_List,
      commerce.productViews.value AS prodView,
      commerce.purchases.value AS purchase
    FROM adobe_analytics_midvalues
    WHERE commerce.productViews.value = 1 OR commerce.purchases.value = 1 OR _experience.analytics.customDimensions.eVars.eVar1 IS NOT NULL
  )
)
WHERE eVar1ConversionSyntax IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 100
```
