# Data Ingestion

Ingest additional datasets, beyond the solution datasets, needed to support planned queries.

These might include:

*   CRM dataset
*   Point-of-sale dataset
*   Experience event dataset from an external system, such as an ad server or e-commerce platform, or any other external dataset

Data is ingested using the Adobe bulk ingestion APIs.
