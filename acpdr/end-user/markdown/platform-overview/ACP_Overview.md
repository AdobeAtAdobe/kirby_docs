Building Experiences with the Adobe Cloud Platform
=============================

The Adobe Cloud Platform provides the tools, services, and a common data language--the Experience Data Model (XDM)--to integrate and standardize your diverse data for efficient sharing between marketing solutions and services. With integrated and consistent customer data, you can efficiently analyze and segment data from a data lake, channel and segment data for real-time decisioning, apply machine learning and artificial intelligence everywhere, and more. All of this data churning, sharing, and analyzing leads to the ultimate opportunityâ€“A Unified Profile allowing for all types of personalized experiences.

The Adobe Cloud Platform lets you build Adobe solutions using a step-by-step user interface or through APIs. The user interface steps you through building datasets and connecting to streaming content, mapping and transforming data, and building custom workflows.  

For developers, the Adobe Cloud Platform includes xxx Adobe Gateway Services for API support on Adobe I/O, Adobe Event Services, and the Adobe Exchange Program to create ETL connectors for partners on the platform. The platform also includes Unified Profiles, machine-learning with AI Services, and employing Adobe Launch for implementation and management.



# Unifying Everything#
The Adobe Cloud Platform brings together data and content across all channels of the user experience, including:

**People**. View the ever-expanding interaction of friends and associates.

**Places**. Enrich profiles from mobile devices for location-enabled apps, analytics, and messaging.

**Assets**. Easily store, sync, and share digital assets to all Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, and sync with Creative Cloud to collaborate with designers.

**Mobile Management**. Manage all your mobile app marketing from a single hub, and understand and improve user engagement with your apps and services.

**Events**. Manage tags across to capture events across all your digital marketing systems to trigger personalized experiences and collect the right data.

The integration of multiple marketing channels is captured in separate XDM schemas, allowing you to define and analyze activities and respond to customer insights faster with less cost. A main goal of standard marketing data is to create a Unified Profile for each customer, leveraging data from fields across the XDM schemas to define the customer experience and to provide profiles that return a personalized experience for the customer.


The Adobe Cloud Platform provides the marketing data and features to leverage a personalized customer experience.

**Provides a complete customer
 profile.** ACP provides a complete profile and real-time view of customers by integrating data and features across systems.

**Derives insights using advanced approaches.** ACP lets you use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, releasing you from a legacy system and enhancing any gaps in data science skills.

**Effectively acts on insights from your marketing data.**  Integrated platform data provides actionable systems.

**Brings together anonymous and authenticated data.**




## A Comprehensive Customer View
A long-held goal of marketers is to bring together all customer information, experience, and behavior into a single, comprehensive view. The ACP combines customer profiles, experiences, and behavior for specific learning and analysis to bring together digital, streaming, and off-line data channels, allowing you to derive specific insights and intelligence for your customers using demographics, engagement, behavior, transactional history, and other views.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ACP-Intro-3.png"  /></p>

The ACP leverages all data to provide insights of the customer experience to drive actions and respond with comprehensive, personalized experiences. The goal is to bring together identifiable and anonymous information and stitch it all together to show the complete customer journey.

- A complete profile of customers to integrate all information across enterprise systems.
- The ability to derive insights using advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, moving away from constraints of legacy systems.
- Effectively act on insights using analytics, targeting, and other actionable responses to customer needs.
- Provide a bridge between anonymous and authenticated data.

The Adobe Cloud Platform allows a 360-degree view to see how customers are engaging with websites, brand, services, devices, and products at any point in time using a consumable format. This allows for all types of interaction.

### Experience Workflow

The five aspects of the Adobe Cloud Platform are part of a common workflow of data collection, labeling and governance, applying analytics and machine learning to gain insights, to enrich customer profiles, and most importantly, to take action in response to new information.

With the Adobe Cloud Platform you get a data foundation, including machine intelligence, and value-added services that are all open to be controlled, customized, and integrated as needed.

### Data Integration
The Adobe Cloud Platform unifies customer data from all types of marketing, sales, and service channels. It enables customer modeling, segmenting, and analyzing, which in turn drives the customer experience for email campaigns, social media call outs, geo-fencing, and web analytics.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ACP-Intro-9.png"  /></p>

Data integration starts with ingesting and streaming datasets from multiple channels: CRM data with personal and demographic information, POS from the and online transactional data, and in-depth behavioral data from web, mobile and integrated device data. It can include data from flat files, streaming data, data shared from Microsoft's Common Data Model (CDM), and data already standardized in Adobe's Experience Data Model (XDM) schemas. If you are not sharing XDM structured data, then you can structure it into a standard schema and run common services.

### The Experience Data Model (XDM)
The Experience Data Model (XDM) provides standard schemas for common data in the Adobe Cloud Platform, allowing applications and services to interact seamlessly across data sources and customers. XDM schemas enable integrating data from all Adobe solutions and external sources and to re-use datasets for different needs.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ACP-Intro-6.png"  /></p>

XDM handles the large and diverse datasets ingested into the platform, and stores the data sources within and across the many standard XDM schemas. In most cases a standard schema exists for a dataset, but if needed you can build your own custom schema.

The schemas standardizes data for the platform not just for taxonomy but for business logic. For example, an organization may struggle to define and distribute a primary statistic or key performance indicator (KPI) in a standard way. Adding a specific XDM schema to store the unique KPI lets you standardize and distribute the performance indicator.



### Unified Profiles
Structuring your data with semantic content then lets you build a comprehensive profile with rich content, allowing you to segment audiences and respond based on XDM data. 

In the Adobe Cloud Platform, you first define your required XDM schemas (standard and custom), and then populate the schemas by ingesting CSV or Parquet files, streaming solution data, and integrating with third-party platform connectors.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ACP-Intro-4.png"  /></p>

### Using Unified Profiles

For example, take the simple use case of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems and Call Center management software integrators. Suppliers use the ACP APIs to ingest historical information of the customer's call center activity in the Experience Data Lake. If the data is ingested in the XDM ExperienceEvent schema, a schema that expresses customer interactions, then these interactions can be ingested into the Unified Profile Service. 

In this example, the *callerId* is used as the customer's identifier. The Indentity Service will take care of identity resolution and assist the Unified Profile Service to add any data points from recent interactions with the Call Center to the customer's profile.

A customer call to the Call Center will first be answered by the IVR. To personalize the message and deliver an offer tailored to the caller, the IVR system contacts the Unified Profile service for a point lookup. The Unified Profile returns the profile attributes that apply just to the call-center interactions, which triggers a personalized response.

### Profile and Identity on the Adobe Cloud Platform
The Adobe Cloud Platform includes both Identity Services (IDS) and a comprehensive Unified Profile service. Identity services captures all relevant public identities and associations for a person, and the profile combines attributes of that person, including the identity relationships, to build a Unified Profile.

For example, the Identity Services know that dude@letsroll.com also has an email account at letsgoroll@yahoo.com. The Identity Services will connect the two. When dude@letsroll.com is accessed, the profile services will call the identity services to find out that letsgoroll@yahoo.com is the same person. Then the profile services will merge the two profile fragments and return a Unified Profile.


### DULE for GDPR
Data Usage Labeling and Enforcement (DULE) from Adobe lets you to label and manage your data as needed, including compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) established in the EU. Data governance encompasses the strategies and technologies used to apply policies and to control access to data, to track changes to datasets, and to ensure data usage is in compliance with regulations, contract terms, and corporate policies.

DULE lets you use DULE to label data based on their governance and compliance needs, and to
set data usage policies for enforcement. 

### AI Studio
The emergence of machine learning allows you to derive insights and intelligence from website analytics, off-line consumer and point-of-sale data, CMS data, email responses, back-end systems, and across all cross-channel marketing data. Using machine learning, you can enact policies for real-time decisioning.


### ETL Connectors for Partners

ETL integration between Adobe and its partner using the [Adobe Exchange
program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud.html) provides features and emplys ACP components to build a user interface and perform direct ETL ingestion.
