DecisionEvents are not only relatable to Experience Events that impacted a decision but also to ExperienceEvents that are a direct response to a proposition. It is the expectation that applications reference the proposition ID in every ExperienceEvent that was influenced by the propositions. The proposition-response history in an individual profile is maintained using proposition IDs.
