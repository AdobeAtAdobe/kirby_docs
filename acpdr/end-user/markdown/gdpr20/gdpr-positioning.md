# Adobe Experience Cloud GDPR Positioning

On May 25, 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will go into effect. Adobe believes this presents a new opportunity for companies to strengthen their brand loyalty by focusing on consumer privacy while delivering amazing experiences. Think of it as experiential privacy - having privacy be a key part of the customer experience through relevant privacy notices presented in context and choices that are on brand. For more information, please refer to [GDPR and Your Business.](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/general-data-protection-regulation.html)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will come into full effect on May 25, 2018. Adobe is already working towards readiness with the new requirements. As compliance will be a shared responsibility with your enterprise, we look forward to partnering with you to address any new obligations for data governance and privacy by design features.

## Adobe as a Processor

When Adobe Experience Cloud is providing software and services to an enterprise, Adobe is acting as a data processor for any personal data it processes and stores as part of providing the services. As a data processor, Adobe only processes personal data in accordance with your company's permission and instructions (for example, as set out in your agreement with Adobe).

## Personal Data Processed by Adobe

As the data controller, you will determine the personal data that Adobe processes and stores on your behalf.

If you use Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, Adobe may host personal data for you depending on the solutions you use and the information you choose to send to your Adobe Experience Cloud account. For a detailed list of examples, see [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html#collect](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html#collect).

## Adobe Readiness

Adobe either already meets, or is working towards meeting, the obligations set out for data processors. For example:

* *Privacy by Design*
    * We have a long-standing practice of incorporating Privacy by Design in the development of our products and services. For example, we provide the capability in Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, and Adobe Target to obfuscate IP addresses and allow individual level opt-outs
* *Security measures*
  * We comply with industry–accepted standards, regulations and certifications, and have implemented technical and organizational measures, as well as hundreds of security processes and controls. ([see https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/security/pdfs/MasterComplianceList.pdf](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/security/pdfs/MasterComplianceList.pdf))
  * We have developed the Adobe Common Controls Framework, a foundational framework of security processes and controls to protect Adobe infrastructure, applications and services. For more information on the Adobe Common Controls Framework, see: [https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/security/pdfs/AdobeCloudServices_ComplianceOverview.pdf](https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/security/pdfs/AdobeCloudServices_ComplianceOverview.pdf)
* *Data transfer*
  * Adobe has certified to the EU-US Privacy Shield for customer-related data. This provides our customers with the option of relying on the EU-US Privacy Shield, or entering into Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as EU Model Clauses), for the transfer of data from the EU to the US. More information on this can be found in our Privacy Center, as well information on how to request Standard Contractual Clauses. ([see https://www.adobe.com/privacy/eudatatransfers.html](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/eudatatransfers.html))
* *Contract terms/Data Processing Agreement*
  * We have updated the Adobe Data Processing Agreement to account for the GDPR requirements
* *Data Protection Officer (DPO)*
  * Adobe currently has a Chief Privacy Officer, an Irish Data Protection Officer and a dedicated privacy team, and we are continuing to evaluate if we need to take any additional steps in light of the new requirements.
* *Records of processing*
  * We are working to more formally document the privacy practices we have in place to comply with the enhanced record keeping requirements

## GDPR API

We've built an API to help process "access" and "delete" requests on behalf of Controllers for their data stored in Experience Cloud

## Consent: Opt-out Management

Every solution and platform at Adobe will be able to help customers comply with their Data Subject's choices. Each solution must adhere to the Adobe Privacy Standards, including:

* [Adobe Privacy Standard](https://www.adobe.com/privacy.html)
* [Adobe Experience Cloud Privacy](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html)
* [Controlling Your Data](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html)
* [Adobe and GDPR](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/general-data-protection-regulation.html)
* [The Adobe Policy for Using Cookies or Other Technology to Access Information on a User's Device](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/cookies.html)

## Consent: Opt-in Management

GDPR has new requirements for active and specific consent by Controllers. GDPR requires Controllers to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data. This consent has to be written and unambiguous. Adobe does not currently offer a consent management solution. However, by using Adobe Launch, our customers could deploy plugins such as Evidon for consent management.
