## GDPR and Experience Cloud Solutions ##

On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect. GDPR is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information of individuals within the European Union (EU). GDPR sets out the principles for data management and the rights of the individual. GDPR covers all companies that deal with the data of EU citizens, so it is a critical regulation for corporate compliance officers at banks, insurers, and other financial companies.

GDPR not only applies to organizations located within the European Union, but it also applies to organizations located outside of the EU if they offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, EU citizens (data subjects) whose personal data is processed by a data controller or processor. GDPR applies to all companies processing and holding personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company's location.

Adobe believes this presents a new opportunity for companies to strengthen their brand loyalty by focusing on consumer privacy while delivering amazing experiences. Adobe already meets or is implementing our obligations as a Data Processor. As a Data Processor, we strive toward GDPR compliance across all Adobe Experience Cloud solutions.

The following table points to articles outlining how to get GDPR-ready with your Experience Cloud Solutions. You will learn how to curate and label your data and how to configure your Experience Cloud Solutions for GDPR request processing using the Adobe GDPR API or tools.
