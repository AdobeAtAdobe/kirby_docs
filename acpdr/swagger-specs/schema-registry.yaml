  title: Schema Registry API
  description: >-
    * Service description:
      * The Schema Registry API is used to access the Schema Library within Adobe Experience Platform. The registry provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all available library resources are accessible.


    * Related documentation:
      * [XDM documentation](http://www.adobe.com/go/xdm-home-en)

    * Visualize API calls with Postman (a free, third-party software):
      * [Schema Registry API Postman collection on GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/blob/master/apis/experience-platform/Schema%20Registry%20API.postman_collection.json)
      * [Video guide for creating the Postman environment](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/28832)
      * [Steps for importing environments and collections in Postman](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collection_runs/using_environments_in_collection_runs/)

    * API paths:
      * PLATFORM Gateway URL: https://<span>platform.adobe.io
      * Base path for this API: /data/foundation/schemaregistry
      * Example of a complete path for making a call to "/stats": https://<span>platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/stats

    * Required headers:
      * All calls require the headers `Authorization`, `x-gw-ims-org-id`, and `x-api-key`. For more information on how to obtain these values, see the [authentication tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en).
      * All resources in Experience Platform are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require the header `x-sandbox-name` whose value is the all-lowercase name of the sandbox the operation will take place in (for example, "prod"). See the [sandboxes overview](https://adobe.com/go/sandbox-overview-en) for more information.
      * All GET requests to the Schema Registry require an `Accept` header to determine what data is returned by the system. See the [section on `Accept` headers](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/api/getting-started.html?lang=en#accept) in the Schema Registry developer guide for more information.
      * All requests with a payload in the request body (such as POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header `Content-Type` with a value of `application/json`.


basePath: /data/foundation/schemaregistry
host: platform.adobe.io
tags:
  - name: "Stats"
    description: Returns {TENANT_ID} along with information regarding IMS Org usage of the Schema Registry such as resource counts, recently created resources, and class usage.
  - name: "Schemas"
    description: Schemas provide an abstract definition of a real-world object along with constraints and expectations that can be applied and used to validate data.
  - name: "Behaviors"
    description: Behaviors define the nature of data that a schema describes. Each XDM class must reference a specific behavior, which all schemas that employ that class will inherit. Schemas that inherit the "record" behavior provide information about the attributes of a subject, while those that inherit the "time-series" behavior provide a snapshot of the system at the time an action was taken by a record subject.
  - name: "Classes"
    description: Classes define behavioral aspects of the data within the schema and describe the smallest number of common properties contained in all schemas that implement the same class.
  - name: "Field groups"
    description: A field group is a reusable component that defines one or more fields to implement certain functions within a schema based on a compatible class.
  - name: "Data types"
    description: Data types are used as reference field types in classes or schemas to define complex types. Data types may define multiple sub-fields providing a consistent multi-field structure.
  - name: "Descriptors"
    description: Schema descriptors are tenant-level metadata used to provide interpretive details on how data based on certain schemas may relate or interact with one another.
  - name: "Unions"
    description: Union schemas aggregate the fields of all schemas that implement the same class (such as ExperienceEvent or Profile) into a single schema. They are used by Real-time Customer Profile to merge data together to form a "single source of truth" for an individual.
  - name: "Export/Import"
    description: The Schema Registry API allows you to transfer and share XDM resources between sandboxes and IMS Organizations. For any schema, field group, or data type, you can generate an export payload containing the structure of the resource and any dependent resources. This payload can then be used to import the resource into a destination sandbox and IMS Org.
  - name: "Sample data"
    description: You can generate sample data for any specified schema within the Schema Library. The response object returned can then be used as the source of dataset ingestion.
  - name: "Audit log"
    description: The Schema Registry maintains a log of all the changes that have occurred to a resource (class, field group, data type, or schema) between different updates.
  - name: "Mixins (deprecated)"
    description: '"Mixin" is the former term for a field group. The /mixins endpoints are deprecated and only maintained as legacy endpoints. For new implementations, please use the /fieldgroups endpoint instead.'

        Schemas define a static view of data entities, but do not provide specific details on how data based on these schemas (datasets) may relate to one another. Adobe Experience Platform allows you to describe these relationships and other interpretive metadata about a schema through the use of descriptors.


        Descriptors are tenant-level metadata for schemas, meaning they are unique to your IMS Organization and all descriptor operations take place in the `tenant` container.


        Each schema can have one or more schema descriptor entities applied to it. Each schema descriptor entity includes a descriptor '@type' and the 'sourceSchema' to which it applies. Once applied, these descriptors will apply to all datasets created using the schema.


        In order to help filter returned data, the Schema Registry supports the use of query parameters when listing descriptors.


        `Accept` headers for descriptors include:


        <table><thead><tr><th>`Accept`</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>`application/vnd.adobe.xdm-id+json`</td><td>Returns a list of descriptor IDs, grouped by their `@type`.</td></tr><tr><td>`application/vnd.adobe.xdm-link+json`</td><td>Returns a list of descriptor API paths, grouped by their `@type`.</td></tr><tr><td>`application/vnd.adobe.xdm+json`</td><td>Returns a list of descriptor objects, grouped by their `@type`.</td></tr><tr><td>`application/vnd.adobe.xdm-v2{-id/-link}+json`</td><td>Including the `-v2` option in any of the above `Accept` headers permits paging functionality, returning a results array with a `_page` attribute that can be used to request the next page if needed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
