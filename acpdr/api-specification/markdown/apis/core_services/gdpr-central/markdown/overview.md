									requests for customers. The service includes a UI for selecting
									and creating requests, a business layer (API) that will
									primarily drive all traffic out and process all traffic into
									the system, and a DB that can store audit and logging
									information along with temporary data retrieval storage while
									requests are pending or waiting to be viewed.
