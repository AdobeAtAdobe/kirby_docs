# Quick start guide
1. To use Query Service, your organization must be provisioned for Adobe Experience Platform, and your administrator needs to grant you access to it. 
2. If you haven't already ingested your data into Adobe Experience Platform, then that is where you should start. Refer to the [data ingestion documentation](../../ingest_architectural_overview/data-ingestion-overview.md).
3. After you have ingested your data into Adobe Experience Platform, you can begin working with Query Service using [Platform UI](../queries-and-ui/ui-overview.md). For example, you can use Adobe Experience Platform's browser-based [Query Editor](../queries-and-ui/query-editor-overview.md) to write, validate, and run queries.


Query Service also provides a way to connect external tools to issue queries. For instructions on connecting a tool such as a Business Intelligence tool or a command line interface, please read [connect a tool](../clients/overview.md).
