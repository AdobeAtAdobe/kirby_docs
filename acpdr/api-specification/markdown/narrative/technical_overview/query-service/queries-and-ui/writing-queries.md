# General guidance for query execution in Query Service

This document details important details to know when writing queries in Adobe Experience Platform Query Service. The following topics are covered:
- [Using different query execution models](#query-execution-models)
- [Accessing schema fields within an object](#working-with-schema-fields-and-objects)
- [Working with single quotes, double quotes, and back quotes](#when-to-use-single-quotes-double-quotes-and-back-quotes)

For detailed information on the SQL syntax used in Query Service, please read the [SQL syntax documentation](../sql/syntax.md).

## Query execution models

Adobe Experience Platform Query Service has two models of query execution: interactive and non-interactive. 

Interactive execution is used for query development and report generation in business intelligence tools, while non-interactive is used for larger jobs and operational queries as a part of a data processing workflow.

### Interactive query execution

Queries can be executed interactively by submitting them through the Query Service UI or [through a connected client][connect-client]. When running Query Service through a connected client, an active session runs between the client and Query Service until either the submitted query returns or times out.

Interactive query execution has the following limitations:

 Parameter       | Limitation   
 --------------- |:-------------:
 Query timeout | 10 minutes 
 Maximum rows returned | 50,000 
 Maximum concurrent queries | 5 

> **Note:** To override the maximum rows limitation, include `LIMIT 0` in your query. The query timeout of 10 minutes still applies. 

By default, the results of interactive queries are returned to the client and are **not** persisted. In order to persist the results as a dataset in Experience Platform, the query must use the `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` syntax.

### Non-interactive query execution

Queries submitted through the Query Service API are run non-interactively. Non-interactive execution means that Query Service receives the API call and executes the query in the order it is received. Non-interactive queries always result in either the generation of a new dataset in Experience Platform to receive the results, or the insertion of new rows into an existing dataset. 

## Accessing a specific field within an object

To access a field within an object in your query, you can use either dot notation (`.`) or bracket notation (`[]`). The following SQL statement uses dot notation to traverse the `endUserIds` object down to the `mcid` object.

  ```sql
  SELECT endUserIds._experience.mcid
  FROM {ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}
  WHERE endUserIds._experience.mcid IS NOT NULL
  LIMIT 1
  ```

  - `{ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}`: The name of your analytics table. 

The following SQL statement uses bracket notation to traverse the `endUserIds` object down to the `mcid` object. 
 
  ```sql
  SELECT endUserIds['_experience']['mcid']
  FROM {ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}
  WHERE endUserIds._experience.mcid IS NOT NULL
  LIMIT 1
  ```

- `{ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}`: The name of your analytics table. 

>**Note:** Since each notation type returns the same results, the one you choose to use is up to your preference.

Both of the example queries above return a flattened object, rather than a single value:

```console
              endUserIds._experience.mcid   
--------------------------------------------------------
 (48168239533518554367684086979667672499,"(ECID)",true)
(1 row)
```

The returned `endUserIds._experience.mcid` object contains the corresponding values for the following parameters:

- `id`
- `namespace`
- `primary`

When the column is only declared down to the object, it returns the entire object as a string. To view only the ID, use:

```sql
SELECT endUserIds._experience.mcid.id
FROM {ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}
WHERE endUserIds._experience.mcid IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1
```

```console 
     endUserIds._experience.mcid.id 
----------------------------------------
 48168239533518554367684086979667672499
(1 row)
```

## When to use single quotes, double quotes, and back quotes

This section explains when to use single quotes, double quotes, and back quotes in queries. 

### Single quotes

The single quote (`'`) is used to create text strings. For example, it can be used in the `SELECT` statement to return a static text value in the result, and in the `WHERE` clause to evaluate the content of a column.

The following query declares a static text value (`'datasetA'`) for a column:
```sql
SELECT 
  'datasetA',
  timestamp,
  web.webPageDetails.name
FROM {ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}
LIMIT 10
```

The following query uses a single-quoted string (`'homepage'`) in its WHERE clause to return events for a specific page.
```sql
SELECT 
  timestamp,
  endUserIds._experience.mcid.id
FROM {ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}
WHERE web.webPageDetails.name = 'homepage'
LIMIT 10
```

### Double quotes

The double quote (`"`) is used to declare an identifier with spaces.

The following query uses double quotes to return values from specified columns when one column contains a space in its identifier:

```sql
SELECT
  no_space_column,
  "space column"
FROM
( SELECT 
    'column1' as no_space_column,
    'column2' as "space column"
)
```

>**Note**: Double quotes **cannot** be used with dot notation field access. 

### Back quotes

The back quote `` ` `` is used to escape reserved column names **only** when using  dot notation syntax. For example, since `order` is a reserved word in SQL, you must use back quotes to access the field `commerce.order`:

```sql
SELECT 
  commerce.`order`
FROM {ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}
LIMIT 10
```

Back quotes are also used to access a field that starts with a number. For example, to access the field `30_day_value`, you would need to use back quote notation.

```SQL
SELECT
    commerce.`30_day_value`
FROM {ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}
LIMIT 10
```

Back quotes are **not** needed if you are using bracket-notation.
```sql
 SELECT
  commerce['order']
 FROM {ANALYTICS_TABLE_NAME}
 LIMIT 10
```
