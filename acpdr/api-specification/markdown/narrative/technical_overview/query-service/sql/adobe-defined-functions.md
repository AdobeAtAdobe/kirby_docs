# Adobe-defined functions

Adobe-defined functions (ADFs) are prebuilt functions in Query Service that help perform common business related tasks on ExperienceEvent data. These include functions for Sessionization and Attribution like those found in Adobe Analytics. See the [Adobe Analytics documentation][Adobe Analytics] for more information about Adobe Analytics and the concepts behind the ADFs defined on this page.

This document provides information for the following Adobe-defined functions available in Query Service:
 - [Window functions](#window-functions)
 - [Sessionization](#sessionization)
 - [Attribution](#attribution)
   - [First touch attribution](#first-touch-attribution)
   - [First touch attribution with expiration condition](#first-touch-attribution-with-expiration-condition)
   - [First touch attribution with expiration timeout](#first-touch-attribution-with-expiration-timeout)
   - [Last touch attribution](#last-touch-attribution)
   - [Last touch attribution with expiration condition](#last-touch-attribution-with-expiration-condition)
   - [Last touch attribution with expiration timeout](#last-touch-attribution-with-expiration-timeout)
 - [Previous/next touch](#previousnext-touch)
   - [Previous touch](#previous-touch)
   - [Next touch](#next-touch)
 - [Time-between](#time-between)
   - [Time-between previous match](#time-between-previous-match)
   - [Time-between next match](#time-between-next-match)

## Window functions

The majority of the business logic requires gathering the touchpoints for a customer and ordering them by time. This support is provided by Spark SQL in the form of window functions. Window functions are part of standard SQL and are supported by many other SQL engines.

A window function updates an aggregation and returns a single item for each row in your ordered subset. The most basic aggregation function is `SUM()`. `SUM()` takes your rows and gives you one total. If you instead apply `SUM()` to a window, turning it into a window function, you receive a cumulative sum with each row.

The majority of the Spark SQL helpers are window functions that update each row in your window, with the state of that row added.

#### Specification

Syntax: `OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| [partition] | A subgroup of the rows based on a column or available field. Example, `PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id` |
| [order] | A column or available field used to order the subset or rows. Example, `ORDER BY timestamp` |
| [frame] | A subgroup of the rows in a partition. Example, `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` |

## Sessionization

When you are working with ExperienceEvent data originating from a website, mobile application, interactive voice response system, or any other customer interaction channel it helps if events can be grouped around a related period of activity. Typically, you have a specific intent driving your activity like researching a product, paying a bill, checking account balance, filling out an application, and so on. This grouping helps associate the events to uncover more context about the customer experience.

For more information about Sessionization in Adobe Analytics, see the documentation on [context-aware sessions][Analytics Sessionization].

#### Specification

Syntax: `SESS_TIMEOUT(timestamp, expirationInSeconds) OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | Timestamp field found in the dataset |
| `expirationInSeconds` | Number of seconds needed between events to qualify the end of the current session and start of a new session |

| Returned Object Parameters |  Description  | 
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| `timestamp_diff`       | Time in seconds between current record and prior record |
| `num`                  | A unqiue session number, starting at 1, for the key defined in the `PARTITION BY` of the window function.   |
| `is_new`               | A boolean used to identify whether a record is the first of a session    |
| `depth`                | Depth of the current record within the session  |

#### Example Query

```sql
SELECT 
  endUserIds._experience.mcid.id as id, 
  timestamp,
  SESS_TIMEOUT(timestamp, 60 * 30)
    OVER (PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id
        ORDER BY timestamp
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
    AS session
FROM experience_events
ORDER BY id, timestamp ASC
LIMIT 10
```

## Attribution

Associating customer actions to success is an important part of understanding the factors that influence customer experience. The following ADFs support First and Last attribution with different expiration settings.

For more information about attribution in Adobe Analytics, see the [Attribution IQ overview][Analytics Attribution] in the Analytics Analyze Guide.

### First touch attribution

Returns the first touch attribution value and details for a single channel in the target ExperienceEvent dataset. The query returns a `struct` object with the first touch value, timestamp, and attribution for each row returned for the selected channel.

This query is useful if you want to see what interaction led to a series of customer actions. In the example shown below, the initial tracking code (`em:946426`) in the ExperienceEvent data is attributed 100% (`1.0`) responsibility for the customer actions as it was the first interaction.

#### Specification

Syntax: `ATTRIBUTION_FIRST_TOUCH(timestamp, channelName, channelValue) OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | Timestamp field found in the dataset |
| `channelName` | A friendly name to use as a label in the returned object |
| `channelValue` | The column or field that is the target channel for the query |


| Returned Object Parameters |  Description  | 
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| `name`       | The `channelName` entered as a label in the ADF |
| `value`      | The value from `channelValue` that is the first touch in the ExperienceEvent |
| `timestamp`  | The timestamp of the ExperienceEvent where the first touch occured |
| `fraction`   | The attribution of the first touch expressed as fractional credit |

#### Example Query

```sql
SELECT endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, timestamp, marketing.trackingCode,
    ATTRIBUTION_FIRST_TOUCH(timestamp, 'Paid First', marketing.trackingCode)
      OVER(PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id
           ORDER BY timestamp
           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
      AS first_touch
FROM experience_events
ORDER BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, timestamp ASC
LIMIT 10
```

#### Results

```

(10 rows)
```

### Last touch attribution

Returns the last touch attribution value and details for a single channel in the target ExperienceEvent dataset. The query returns a `struct` object with the last touch value, timestamp, and attribution for each row returned for the selected channel.

This query is useful if you want to see the final interaction in a series of customer actions. In the example shown below, the tracking code in the returned object is the last interaction in each ExperienceEvent record. Each code is attributed 100% (`1.0`) responsibility for the customer actions as it was the last interaction.

#### Specification

Syntax: `ATTRIBUTION_LAST_TOUCH(timestamp, channelName, channelValue) OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | Timestamp field found in the dataset |
| `channelName` | A friendly name to use as a label in the returned object |
| `channelValue` | The column or field that is the target channel for the query |


| Returned Object Parameters |  Description  | 
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| `name`       | The `channelName` entered as a label in the ADF |
| `value`      | The value from `channelValue` that is the last touch in the ExperienceEvent |
| `timestamp`  | The timestamp of the ExperienceEvent where the `channelValue` was used |
| `fraction`   | The attribution of the last touch expressed as fractional credit |

#### Example Query
```sql
SELECT endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, timestamp, marketing.trackingCode,
    ATTRIBUTION_LAST_TOUCH(timestamp, 'trackingCode', marketing.trackingCode)
      OVER(PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id

### First touch attribution with expiration condition

Returns the first touch attribution value and details for a single channel in the target ExperienceEvent dataset, expiring after or before a condition. The query returns a `struct` object with the first touch value, timestamp, and attribution for each row returned for the selected channel.

This query is useful if you want to see what interaction led to a series of customer actions within a portion of the ExperienceEvent dataset determined by a condition of your chosing. In the example shown below, a purchase is recorded (`commerce.purchases.value IS NOT NULL`) on each of the four days shown in the results (July 15, 21, 23, and 29) and the initial tracking code on each day is attributed 100% (`1.0`) responsibility for the customer actions.

#### Specification

Syntax: `ATTRIBUTION_FIRST_TOUCH_EXP_IF(timestamp, channelName, channelValue, expCondition, expBefore) OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | Timestamp field found in the dataset |
| `channelName` | A friendly name to use as a label in the returned object |
| `channelValue` | The column or field that is the target channel for the query |
| `expCondition` | The condition that determines the expiry point of the channel |
| `expBefore` | Defaults to `false`. Boolean to indicate if the channel expires before or after the specified condition is met. Primarily enabled for a session expiry conditions (for example, `sess.depth = 1, true`), to ensure that the first touch is not selected from a previous session. |

| Returned Object Parameters |  Description  | 
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| `name`       | The `channelName` entered as a label in the ADF |
| `value`      | The value from `channelValue` that is the first touch in the ExperienceEvent prior to the `expCondition` |
| `timestamp`  | The timestamp of the ExperienceEvent where the first touch occured |
| `fraction`   | The attribution of the first touch expressed as fractional credit |

#### Example Query
```sql
SELECT endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, timestamp, marketing.trackingCode,
    ATTRIBUTION_FIRST_TOUCH_EXP_IF(timestamp, 'Paid First', marketing.trackingCode, commerce.purchases.value IS NOT NULL, false)
      OVER(PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id
           ORDER BY timestamp
           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
      AS first_touch
FROM experience_events
ORDER BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, timestamp ASC
```

### First touch attribution with expiration timeout

Returns the first touch attribution value and details for a single channel in the target ExperienceEvent dataset for a specified time period. The query returns a `struct` object with the first touch value, timestamp, and attribution for each row returned for the selected channel.

This query is useful if you want to see what interaction, within a selected time interval, led to a customer action. In the example shown below, the first touch returned for each customer action is the earliest interaction within the previous seven days (`expTimeout = 86400 * 7`).

#### Specification

Syntax: `ATTRIBUTION_FIRST_TOUCH_EXP_TIMEOUT(timestamp, channelName, channelValue, expTimeout) OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | Timestamp field found in the dataset |
| `channelName` | A friendly name to use as a label in the returned object |
| `channelValue` | The column or field that is the target channel for the query |
| `expTimeout` | The window of time (in seconds) prior to the channel event that the query searches for a first touch event |

| Returned Object Parameters |  Description  | 
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| `name`       | The `channelName` entered as a label in the ADF |
| `value`      | The value from `channelValue` that is the first touch within the specified `expTimeout` interval |
| `timestamp`  | The timestamp of the ExperienceEvent where the first touch occured |
| `fraction`   | The attribution of the first touch expressed as fractional credit |

#### Example Query

```sql
SELECT endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, timestamp, marketing.trackingCode,
    ATTRIBUTION_FIRST_TOUCH_EXP_TIMEOUT(timestamp, 'Paid First', marketing.trackingCode, 86400 * 7)
      OVER(PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id

### Last touch attribution with expiration condition

Returns the last touch attribution value and details for a single channel in the target ExperienceEvent dataset, expiring after or before a condition. The query returns a `struct` object with the last touch value, timestamp, and attribution for each row returned for the selected channel.

This query is useful if you want to see the last interaction in a series of customer actions within a portion of the ExperienceEvent dataset determined by a condition of your chosing. In the example shown below, a purchase is recorded (`commerce.purchases.value IS NOT NULL`) on each of the four days shown in the results (July 15, 21, 23, and 29) and the last tracking code on each day is attributed 100% (`1.0`) responsibility for the customer actions.

#### Specification

Syntax: `ATTRIBUTION_LAST_TOUCH_EXP_IF(timestamp, channelName, channelValue, expCondition, expBefore) OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | Timestamp field found in the dataset |
| `channelName` | A friendly name to use as a label in the returned object |
| `channelValue` | The column or field that is the target channel for the query |
| `expCondition` | The condition that determines the expiry point of the channel |
| `expBefore` | Defaults to `false`. Boolean to indicate if the channel expires before or after the specified condition is met. Primarily enabled for session expiry conditions (for example, `sess.depth = 1, true`), to ensure that the last touch is not selected from a previous session. |

| Returned Object Parameters |  Description  | 
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| `name`       | The `channelName` entered as a label in the ADF |
| `value`      | The value from `channelValue` that is the last touch in the ExperienceEvent prior to the `expCondition` |
| `timestamp`  | The timestamp of the ExperienceEvent where the last touch occured |
| `percentage`   | The attribution of the last touch expressed as fractional credit |

#### Example Query

```sql
SELECT endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, timestamp, marketing.trackingCode,
    ATTRIBUTION_LAST_TOUCH_EXP_IF(timestamp, 'trackingCode', marketing.trackingCode, commerce.purchases.value IS NOT NULL, false)
      OVER(PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id
           ORDER BY timestamp
           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
      AS last_touch

| `channelName` | A friendly name to use as a label in the returned object |
| `channelValue` | The column or field that is the target channel for the query |
| `expTimeout` | The window of time (in seconds) after to the channel event that the query searches for a last touch event |

| Returned Object Parameters |  Description  | 
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| `name`       | The `channelName` entered as a label in the ADF |
| `value`      | The value from `channelValue` that is the last touch within the specified `expTimeout` interval |
| `timestamp`  | The timestamp of the ExperienceEvent where the last touch occured |
| `percentage`   | The attribution of the last touch expressed as fractional credit |

## Previous/next touch

Understanding how customers navigate within an experience is important. It can be used to understand the customer's depth of engagement, confirm the intended steps of an experience are working as designed, and identify potential pain points impacting the customer. The following ADFs support establishing pathing views from their Previous and Next relationships. You'll be able to create Previous Page and Next Page, or step through multiple events to create Pathing. 

### Previous touch

Determines the previous value of a particular field a defined number of steps away within the window. Notice in the example that the `WINDOW` Function is configured with a frame of `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` setting the ADF to look at the current row and all before it.

#### Specification

Syntax: `PREVIOUS(key, [shift, [ignoreNulls]]) OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `key` | The column or field from the event. |
| `shift` | (optional) The number of events away from the current event. Default is 1. |
| `ingnoreNulls` | Boolean to indicated if null `key` values should be ignored. Default is `false`. |


| Returned Object Parameters |  Description  | 
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| `value`      | The value based on the `key` used in the ADF |

#### Example Query

```sql
SELECT endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, _experience.analytics.session.num, timestamp, web.webPageDetails.name
    PREVIOUS(web.webPageDetails.name, 3)
      OVER(PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, _experience.analytics.session.num
           ORDER BY timestamp
           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
      AS previous_page
FROM experience_events
ORDER BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id, _experience.analytics.session.num, timestamp ASC
```

#### Results
```
                id                 |       timestamp       |                 name                |                    previous_page

## Time-between

Time-between allows you to explore latent customer behavior within a period before or after an event occurs. Look at the events within 7 days after a campaign or other type of event across all your customers.

### Time-between previous match

Provides a new dimension, which measures the time that has elapsed since a particular incident.

#### Specification

Syntax: `TIME_BETWEEN_PREVIOUS_MATCH(timestamp, eventDefintion, [timeUnit]) OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | Timestamp field found in the dataset populated on all events. |
| `eventDefintion` | Expression to qualify the previous event. |
| `timeUnit` | Unit of output: days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Default is seconds.  |

Output: Returns a number representing the unit of time since the previous matching event was seen or remains null if no matching event was found.

#### Example Query

```sql
SELECT 
  page_name,
  SUM (time_between_previous_match) / COUNT(page_name) as average_minutes_since_registration
FROM
(
SELECT 
  endUserIds._experience.mcid.id as id,

### Time-between next match

Provides a new dimension, which measures the time before a particular event occurs.

#### Specification

Syntax: `TIME_BETWEEN_NEXT_MATCH(timestamp, eventDefintion, [timeUnit]) OVER ([partition] [order] [frame])`

| Parameter | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | Timestamp field found in the dataset populated on all events. |
| `eventDefintion` | Expression to qualify the next event. |
| `timeUnit` | Unit of output: days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Default is seconds.  |

Output: Returns a negative number representing the unit of time behind the next matching event or remains null if a matching event is not found.

#### Example Query
```
SELECT 
  page_name,
  SUM (time_between_next_match) / COUNT(page_name) as average_minutes_until_order_confirmation
FROM
(
SELECT 
  endUserIds._experience.mcid.id as id, 
  timestamp, web.webPageDetails.name as page_name, 
  TIME_BETWEEN_NEXT_MATCH(timestamp, web.webPageDetails.name='Shopping Cart|Order Confirmation', 'minutes')
    OVER(PARTITION BY endUserIds._experience.mcid.id
       ORDER BY timestamp
       ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
    AS time_between_next_match
FROM experience_events
)
WHERE time_between_next_match IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY page_name
ORDER BY average_minutes_until_order_confirmation DESC
LIMIT 10
```

#### Results
```
             page_name             | average_minutes_until_order_confirmation
