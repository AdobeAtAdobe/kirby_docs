# Adobe Experience Decisioning
Experience Decisioning is a capability that can be used to create personalized and optimized experiences in applications running on the Experience Platform. Experience Decisioning allows a marketer to select the next best action from a set of available choices. These choices, also called alternatives or options, can include product recommendations, content components for a web experience, conversation scripts (for the Next Best Conversation use case), and Offers or Actions to take, also referred to as NBXs (Next Best Xs). 

With Experience Decisioning, applications can reuse business logic as well as share a catalog of decision options across channels and applications. The end-to-end customer experience is no longer cut up into disjointed treatments served by independent applications or business functions.  

Instead of managing decision options – and strategies for selecting them –  deeply inside an application, those options and strategies can now be leveraged regardless of when, how and on which channel a customer’s end user interacts with a business or organization.
