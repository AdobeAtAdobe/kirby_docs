# Unified Profile Overview

## 1. Overview

The Unified Profile Service (UPS) in Adobe Cloud Platform provides a Unified, 360Â° Consumer Profile that enables marketers to drive coordinated, consistent and relevant experiences with their audiences across channels. With Unified Profile, you have one place to go to get a holistic view of your entire user base aggregated across all systems, as well as actionable timestamped account of every event they've had in any of your systems, when you need it.

## 2. Ingesting XDM Data

UPS maintains XDM data in the Profile Store which can be updated via batch or stream ingestion. 

### 2.1 Batch Ingestion

XDM data can be ingested into the Unified Profile Service from batch data being [ingested](../allservices.html.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/ingest_architectural_overview/ingest_architectural_overview.md) and managed by Data Catalog Service. 

Both enablement and configuration for ingestion by Unified Profile are handled by a Tag on a DataSet, named specifically "unifiedProfile". The following is an example Patch request adding the `unifiedProfile` Tag, where the `enabled` property set to true enables the DataSet for ingestion into UPS. As Unified Profile can contain a number of identifiers from possibly several different systems, identifying the primary identifier is handled using a query string specifying which value in the XDM schema to use. The `identityField` Tag property names the location in the XDM schema of the primary identity field; `endUserIds.mcId.id` in the example below. (Note that the `identityField` will be deprecated once XDM adds support for it)

__Example Data Catalog Service request - Add Unified Profile configuration tag:__

```
PATCH /data/foundation/catalog/dataSets/5a7d26e92a6e55000086d459 HTTP/1.1

Body:

{
    "tags" :  {
        "unifiedProfile": ["enabled:true", "identityField:endUserIds.mcId.id"]
    }
}
```

## 3. Accessing Profiles in the Unified Profile Service

Access a Unified Profile as it is stored on the hub. 

### 3.1 Access Unified Profile By Record ID

The following example demonstrates the use of the `fields` parameter to limit the fields returned.

___Example Unified Profile Service request for a Unified Profile:___

```
GET /data/core/ups/models/profile/5a7d26e92a6e55000086d459?fields=endUserIds.mcId.id,person.firstName,person.lastName,emails.address
```

___Example response (given example request):___

```
{
  "endUserIds":
    {
      "mcId": {
        "id": "5a7d26e92a6e55000086d459"
      }
    },
  "person": {
    "firstName": "Paul",
    "lastName": "Pennington"
  },
  "emails": [
    {
      "address": "ppennington@email.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Segmenting Your Audience

The cornerstone of your marketing campaign is your audience. Unified Profile Services provides the tools for segmenting your user base into Segments with exactly the precision you require, working with the major components of segmentation.

* __Segments__ are a classified subsets of your user base, such as "Men over 50"
* __Predicates__ define the Segment rules in terms of the conditions that an XDM object must be met to qualify for a Segment
* __Segmentation Jobs__ are scheduled or manually invoked to apply Predicates to your DataSet, creating an Audience
* An __Audience__ is the collection of XDM objects which met the qualifications, or condition, as set out by the Segment Predicate

Segmentation is supported for XDM Profile and ExperienceEvent schemas, with plans to expand to include additional schemas in the future. Segmentation is handled in the steps described by the remainder of this section.

### 4.1 Define a Segment

Your first step is to define the rules for the segment, which is to create the Segment Predicate. Predicates built from Profile (as in CRM data) and ExperienceEvents (as in touchpoint events) can isolate subsets of your user base such as:

* Users for whom one week has passed since last making a purchase
* Users for whom the sum of the purchases is greater than $10,000 
* Users who have seen a campaign and then clicked on it within 30 minutes, for any 3 of a list of campaigns specified by their campaign id

#### 4.1.1 Create a Predicate

Create a Predicate which can then be run by ID or name against XDM data to build your Audience - those XDM objects which qualified for the rule. Predicates are queries built using PQL; a query language designed to build conditions which can be applied to XDM data.  The examples listed below reference a q# shorthand for more detailed examples in section 4.1.2 further in the document. 

* Queries may be over Profile-only (e.g. q1), ExperienceEvent-only (e.g. q5), or a combination of Profile and ExperienceEvent (q11).
* Queries can contain variables, which allow conditions over multiple objects to be specified (e.g. q10: two orders within a two-week period).
* Query validation against XDM schemas.
* Operators/functions:
  * Boolean operators (and, or, not) - e.g. q2.
  * Equality, inequality (=, !=)
  * Numerical comparisons (<, >, <=, >=) - e.g. q1, q3.
  * Time series conditions: occurs - e.g. q7, q10.
  * Others: like, in - e.g. q2, q4.
  * Set formation over variable definitions: {} - e.g. q6-q11.
  * Count

### 4.2 Segment Your Base

Predicates are run against stored XDM data and the data streaming in from various events, creating an Audience. Segmentation can be performed asynchronously using Segment Jobs, with support for realtime segmentation coming soon.

#### 4.2.1 Create a Segment Job

A Segment Job is a queued process of running one or more Predicates against your Adobe Cloud Platform XDM data which either builds or rebuilds the Audience for each Segment. 

__Example request to create a Segment Job:__

```
POST /data/core/ups/segment/jobs HTTP/1.1

Body:

{
    "type": "BATCH",
    "predicateIds": "1234",
    "model": "Profile"
}

Example Response:

{
    "status": true,
    "segmentJob": {
        "id": 3456,
        "type": "string",
        "imsOrgId": "string",
        "status": "string",
        "progress": "string",
        "predicateIds": "string",
        "predicates": "string",
        "model": "string",
        "computeJobId": 0,
        "dataStart": "string",
        "dataEnd": "string",
        "dataGraphType": "string",
        "sink": "string",
        "mergeStrategy": "string",
        "creationTime": "2018-03-20T08:08:43.952Z",
        "updateTime": "2018-03-20T08:08:43.952Z"
    }
}
```

Segment Jobs run asynchronously, though a job's status can be checked by GETting a Segment Job by ID (returned from creating the Segment Job), which will return its status.

```
GET /data/core/ups/segment/jobs/3456 HTTP/1.1

Example Response:

{
    "status": true,
    "segmentJob": {
        "id": 0,
        "type": "string",
        "imsOrgId": "string",
        "status": "string",
        "progress": "string",
        "predicateIds": "string",
        "predicates": "string",
        "model": "string",
        "computeJobId": 0,
        "dataStart": "string",
        "dataEnd": "string",
        "dataGraphType": "string",
        "sink": "string",
        "mergeStrategy": "string",
        "creationTime": "2018-03-20T08:24:07.200Z",
        "updateTime": "2018-03-20T08:24:07.200Z"
    }
}
```
