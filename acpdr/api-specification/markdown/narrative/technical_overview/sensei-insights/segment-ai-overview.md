# Segment AI overview

> **Note:** Segment AI is currently in alpha, and therefore the functionalities outlined in this document are subject to change.

Segment AI in Real-time Customer Data Platform is a deep learning model used to automatically identify audience segments based on your customers' journeys and their interactions with your products or services. Segment AI provides insights to help you better understand your customers and it has the ability to generate audience segments known as clusters to target customers with similar traits at-scale.

## Big data audience problem

Discovering segments is a challenging and time consuming task because of the sheer number of touch points and the complex nature of audience-to-brand interactions. This problem only gets more challenging when you are dealing with multiple brands across multiple categories. Discovering segments of customers often leads to dealing with a high dimensional, sparse, and complex graph of data that makes identifying meaningful segments challenging.

## Understanding Segment AI

### Auto generated segments

 Auto segmentation discovers interesting segments based on mathematical representations by combining customers into different clusters. The profiles with the most similar interaction patterns are clustered, making it possible to identify what traits they have in common with each other.

### Scoring customer visits 

Segment AI uses scoring and produces a compressed mathematical representation of each customer's journey based on their interaction with your brand's sites and applications. This compressed representation can be used for nearly all use cases since the context of the type of service or product you are offering is ignored. Only how a customer interacted with your service is taken into consideration. 

### Segment expansion

A given segment can be expanded by finding additional customers with similar traits or usage patterns and adding them to that segment. This allows for the dynamic creation of larger segments that are based on how those customers interact with and respond to your brand. For example, customers who experience similar behaviors to customers that made a purchase can be grouped together. This allows for expanding  of a segment that goes beyond the initial search data or parameters.

## Segment AI visualizations

Segment AI is able to generate a visualization showcasing clusters of audiences that you can use for exploration and discovery. Using the built in selector, you can investigate clusters individually or together in order to uncover new insights. These insights can be used in targeted marketing campaigns and for understanding customer pain points. You can currently select how you wish to view your clusters based on **High Influence** (percentage) or **High Popularity** (total number) and the visualization changes accordingly.

## Examples of business use cases:

Segment AI can be used to assist with the following example use cases:

- **Customer experience personalization**: Enhance customer experience at the individual level by analyzing and identifying the different personas that exist within your audiences, such as people interested in appliances, people interested in tools, and people interested in flooring supplies.
   
- **Advertising channel optimization**: Automatically analyze audience profiles allowing for the separation of different behavioral groups. This makes it easier to advertise to each group individually when running acquisition and retention campaigns.
  
- **Email campaign optimization**: Identify individual audiences so that you can craft custom email campaigns for each group.
