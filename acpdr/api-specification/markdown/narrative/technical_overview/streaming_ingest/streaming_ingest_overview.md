# Streaming ingestion overview

Streaming ingestion for Adobe Experience Platform provides users a method to send data from client and server-side devices to Experience Platform in real-time.

## What can you do with streaming ingestion?

Adobe Experience Platform enables you to drive coordinated, consistent, and relevant experiences by generating a Real-time Customer Profile for each of your individual customers. Streaming ingestion plays a key role in building these profiles by enabling you to deliver Profile data into the Data Lake with as little latency as possible.

### Stream profile records and ExperienceEvents

With streaming ingestion, users can stream profile records and ExperienceEvents to Platform in seconds to help drive real-time personalization. All data sent to streaming ingestion APIs is automatically persisted in the Data Lake.

Please read the [create a streaming connection guide](./creating_a_streaming_connection.md) for more information.

### Stream to datasets

Once you are confident that your data is clean, you can enable your datasets for Real-time Customer Profile and Identity Service.

For more information on enabling a dataset for Profile and Identity Service, please read the [configure a dataset guide](../../tutorials/unified_profile_dataset_tutorial/unified_profile_dataset_api_tutorial.md).

## What is the expected latency for streaming ingestion on Platform?

| Destination | Expected latency | 
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Real-time Customer Profile | < 1 minute |
| Data Lake | < 60 minutes |

## Adobe Experience Platform Extension
