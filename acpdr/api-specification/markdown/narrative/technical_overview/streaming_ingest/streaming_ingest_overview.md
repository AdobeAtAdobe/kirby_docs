# Streaming Ingestion Overview

## Overview

Streaming Ingestion for Adobe Experience Platform provides users a method to send data from client and server-side devices to Experience Platform in real-time.

## What can you do with Streaming Ingestion?

The most important goal of Platform is to create a complete, high fidelity, and real-time Unified Profile that can drive hyper-personalized experiences. Streaming Ingestion plays a key role in delivering data to Unified Profile and Data Lake with as little latency as possible.

### Stream profile records and ExperienceEvents

With streaming ingestion, users can stream profile records and ExperienceEvents to Platform in seconds to help drive real-time personalization. All data sent to streaming ingestion APIs is automatically persisted in the Data Lake.

Publishers can send data to an existing dataset or have one created automatically for them.
