## ECID - An Essential Tool

Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service (ECID) is the client side module providing access to identity management, serving three primary functions:

*  Identify each visitor 
*  Provide synchronization with Partners 
*  Feed pairwise links to connect with offline or other IDs to the graph

Identifying your online users requires instrumentizing your site or mobile app with the ECID, which provides a universal and persistent ID that identifies your visitors across all solutions in Adobe Experience Platform.
 
If you are working with a website implementation, explore the resources [here](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid).

If you are working with a mobile app, see how ECID is used to [track visitors between an app and mobile web](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/ios/hybrid_app.html).

Deploying these tools can be simple and easy to manage if you use [Adobe Launch](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/overview.html).

Also, see the [GDPR Documentation](https://www.adobe.io/apis/cloudplatform/gdpr/docs/alldocs.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/gdpr/gathering-your-ids.md) for information on using ECID for GDPR compliance.
