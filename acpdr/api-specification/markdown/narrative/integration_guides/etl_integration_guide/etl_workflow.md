# ETL Workflow

Various extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools may differ in format, but most expose similar functionality to assist with the combining of multiple data sources.

## ETL Tool Example

The following diagrams provide mock-ups of common ETL actions and a generic user experience based on standard interactions. These images could easily be adapted for a specific ETL user experience. 
 
The actions illustrated below are described in the steps outlined within the [ETL Integration Guide](etl_integration_guide.md). Some steps reference specific "Figures", others describe similar actions to the workflow shown here.
