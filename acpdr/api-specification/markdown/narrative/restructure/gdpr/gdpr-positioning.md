# Adobe GDPR Positioning

On May 25, 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will go into effect. Adobe believes this presents a new opportunity for companies to strengthen their brand loyalty by focusing on consumer privacy while delivering amazing experiences. Think of it as experiential privacy - having privacy be a key part of the customer experience through relevant privacy notices presented in context and choices that are on brand. For more information, please refer to [GDPR and Your Business](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/general-data-protection-regulation.html).

The [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](gdpr-terminology.html#GDPR) will come into full effect on May 25, 2018. Adobe is already working towards compliance with the new requirements. As compliance will be a shared responsibility with your enterprise, we look forward to partnering with you to address any new obligations for data governance and privacy by design features.

## Adobe as a Controller or Processor

When Adobe is providing software and services to an enterprise, Adobe is acting as a data processor for any personal data it processes and stores as part of providing the services.  As a [data processor](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Processor), Adobe only processes [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#PII) in accordance with your company's permission and instructions (for example, as set out in your agreement with Adobe).

## Personal Data Processed by Adobe

As the [data controller](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Controller), you will determine the [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#PII) that Adobe processes and stores on your behalf.

If you use Adobe Creative Cloud or Adobe Document Cloud hosted services, you may upload content that includes [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#PII) – for example, forms, contracts, photos and artwork containing people. Adobe's Creative Cloud and Document Cloud hosted services include the storage of this [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#PII).

If you use Adobe Experience Cloud (AEC) solutions, Adobe may host [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#PII) for you depending on the solutions you use and the information you choose to send to your AEC account. For a detailed list of examples, see  [https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html#collect](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html#collect).

## Adobe Strives for Compliance

Adobe either already meets, or is working towards meeting, the obligations set out for [data processors](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Processor). For example:

* [*Privacy by Design*](gdpr-terminology.html#Privacy_by_Design)
 - We have a long-standing practice of incorporating [Privacy by Design](gdpr-terminology.html#Privacy_by_Design) in the development of our products and services. For example, we provide the capability in Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, and Adobe Target to obfuscate IP addresses and allow individual level opt-outs
* *Security measures*
 - We comply with industry–accepted standards, regulations and certifications, and have implemented technical and organizational measures, as well as hundreds of security processes and controls. [(see https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/security/pdfs/MasterComplianceList.pdf](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/security/pdfs/MasterComplianceList.pdf))
  - We have developed the Adobe Common Controls Framework, a foundational framework of security processes and controls to protect Adobe infrastructure, applications and services. For more information on Adobe's Common Controls Framework, see:  [https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/security/pdfs/AdobeCloudServices_ComplianceOverview.pdf](https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/security/pdfs/AdobeCloudServices_ComplianceOverview.pdf)
* *Data transfer*
 - Adobe has certified to the EU-US Privacy Shield for customer-related data. This provides our customers with the option of relying on the EU-US Privacy Shield, or entering into Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as EU Model Clauses), for the transfer of data from the EU to the US. More information on this can be found in our Privacy Center, as well information on how to request Standard Contractual Clauses. [(see https://www.adobe.com/privacy/eudatatransfers.html](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/eudatatransfers.html))
* *Contract terms/Data Processing Agreement*
 - We have updated Adobe's Data Processing Agreement to account for the GDPR requirements
* [*Data Protection Officer (DPO)*](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Protection_Officer)
 - Adobe currently has a Chief Privacy Officer, an Irish Data Protection Officer and a dedicated privacy team, and we are continuing to evaluate if we need to take any additional steps in light of the new requirements.
* *Records of processing*
 - We are working to more formally document the privacy practices we have in place to comply with the enhanced record keeping requirements

## Access to [Personal Data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data)

Every solution and platform at Adobe will offer a mechanism that enables customers (or [Data Subjects)](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Subject) to access and view their [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data) in human-readable form. Each mechanism will adhere to GDPR compliance and maintain an audit trail of each request. Each mechanism will permit access to a [Data Subject's](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Subject) [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data) using an API.

## Updates or Corrections to [Personal Data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data)

Every solution and platform at Adobe will offer a mechanism that enables customers (or [Data Subjects)](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Subject) to update or correct their [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data). Data required to be corrected by Adobe is [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#PII) for which Adobe systems are the source of truth. The mechanism must maintain an audit trail of the request and compliance with the request.

For correction requests of other types of data, the request will be logged, and any actions taken will be noted in the log.

Adobe will provide a process to propogate corrections to third-party data providers.

## Deletion of [Personal Data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data)

Every solution and platform at Adobe will offer a mechanism that enables customers to delete a [Data Subject's](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Subject) [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data) on demand. Deletion must include all [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data) pertaining to the [Data Subject](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Subject).

The mechanism will adhere to compliance and maintain an audit trail of the request.

The mechanism will permit access to and deletion of [Data Subject](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Subject) [personal data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data) using an API.

Adobe will perform a deletion within a commercially reasonable timeframe and will provide the customer with a notification of destruction.

For third-party data, Adobe will provide a process for ensuring the third-party is notified of the deletion request to ensure it is no longer provided to Adobe as part of a data feed.

## Retention of [Personal Data](gdpr-terminology.html#Personal_Data)

Every solution and platform at Adobe will comply with Adobe's [Data Retention Standard](https://inside.corp.adobe.com/content/dam/privacy/documents/Standard_Privacy_ProdDev_09.06.01_AMC_CustomerDataRetention.pdf), including timely deletion of terminated Customers' data.

Adobe will provide processes and guidelines so that appropriate actions are taken to stop processing data upon termination/expiration of a contract.

## Consent: Opt-out Management

Every solution and platform at Adobe will be able to help customers comply with their [Data Subject's](gdpr-terminology.html#Data_Subject) choices. Each solution must adhere to the Adobe Privacy Standards related to opt-out's - specifically:
* [Adobe's Browser Privacy Controls Standard](https://inside.corp.adobe.com/content/dam/privacy/documents/Standard_Privacy__ProdDev_09.08.01_BrowserPrivacyControls.pdf)
* [Building Opt-Outs into Adobe Marketing Cloud Products and Services](https://inside.corp.adobe.com/content/dam/privacy/documents/Standard_Privacy__ProdDev_09.08.03_BuidlingOptOuts_MarketingCloud.pdf)
* [Adobe's Policy for Using Cookies or Other Technology to Access Information on a User's Device](https://inside.corp.adobe.com/content/dam/privacy/documents/Policy_Privacy_Marketing_Cookies%20.pdf)
