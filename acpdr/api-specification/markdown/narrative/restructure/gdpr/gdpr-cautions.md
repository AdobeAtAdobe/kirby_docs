# Adobe GDPR Cautions

* Adobe does not provide consent management services. As the data controller, please review your consent management strategy with internal stakeholders.

* API coding is required to send Adobe GDPR requests

* Deploying JavaScript tag is strongly recommended 

* Mobile SDK updates are recommended if you have mobile apps that use our SDKs 

* If you want to “access” and “delete”, send us two different requests, one for accessing your data and another for deletion

* As good partners we'd like to remind you that you should engage with all your processors in passing “delete me” notices to them 

* Data Subjects are responsible for opting out of cross-site advertising, independent of any "delete" requests, i.e. the customer is responsible for doing this using the customer's opt-out tools. 

* Remind Data Subjects, GDPR requests must be issued from each device in which they are interested

* As a processor, Adobe processes whatever IDs controllers send us. If controllers do not send us Adobe related IDs, we don’t return anything. However, we encourage them to send us IDs we can process using the JS tag.
