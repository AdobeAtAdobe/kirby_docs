# Adobe GDPR Cautions

* Adobe is not in consent management business 

* API coding is required to send us GDPR requests

* Deploying JavaScript tag is strongly recommended 

* Mobile SDK updates are recommended if you have mobile apps that use our SDKs 

* If you want to “opt out” and “delete”, send us two different signals, one for opting out and another for deletion

* As good partners we'd like to remind you that you should engage with all your processors in passing “delete me” notices to them 

* Tell Data Subjects on a “delete” request that they must opt out of cross-site advertising (customer owns the method for doing this, we provide the ad-tech opt-out code) 

* Remind Data Subjects, GDPR requests must be issued from each device in which they are interested

* As a processor, Adobe processes whatever IDs controllers send us. If controllers do not send us Adobe related IDs, we don’t return anything. However, we encourage them to send us IDs we can process using the JS tag.
