# Message

A message part of a campaign activity.
A message is created each `Profile` targeted in a `Delivery`. If a profile
is targeted twice within the same delivery, two messages will be created.

## Properties

###  profile
[`experience.Profile.schema`](../../../../experience/Profile.schema.md)

This property is primarily used to link the message to a Profile using the EndCustomerId
but it can also be used to freeze some properties of the profile at the time the message
was sent.

If that number is over 160 the message will be delivered over more than one SMS.
