# Privacy Service and Experience Cloud applications

Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service is built to support privacy requests for several Adobe Experience Cloud applications. Each application supports different product values and IDs for identifying data subjects.

This document serves as a reference for Experience Cloud application documentation that outlines how to configure that application for privacy-related operations. This includes how to format and label your data. Two categories of applications are covered:

* [Applications integrated with Privacy Service](#applications-integrated-with-privacy-service): Applications that are able to send access, delete, or opt-out requests to Privacy Service.
* [Self-serve applications](#self-serve-applications): Applications that must manage their privacy requests internally, and cannot communicate with Privacy Service directly.

Please review the documentation for your Experience Cloud applications to learn how to format your privacy requests, and which values are supported for those requests.
