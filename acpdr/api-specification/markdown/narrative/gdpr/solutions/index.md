# GDPR and Experience Cloud solutions

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that establishes guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information of individuals within the European Union (EU). As a data processor, Adobe strives toward GDPR compliance across all Adobe Experience Cloud solutions. For a general overview of how GDPR applies to Experience Cloud, see the [GDPR whitepaper](../gdpr-whitepaper). For definitions to GDPR-related terms, see the [GDPR terminology](../gdpr-terminology.md) article.

Each Experience Cloud solution supports different product values and IDs for identifying data subjects. The following table is a list of Experience Cloud solutions and the corresponding documentation that outlines how to configure each solution to be GDPR-compliant. Please review the documentation for your Experience Cloud solutions to learn which values are supported.
