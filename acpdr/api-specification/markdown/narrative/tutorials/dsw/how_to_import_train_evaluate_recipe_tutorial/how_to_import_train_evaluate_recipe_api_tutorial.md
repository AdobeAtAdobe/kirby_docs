## Objective
In this step by step tutorial, we will consume the APIs which allow us to create a Recipe, an Experiment, scheduled Experiment Runs, and trained Models. For a detailed list of API documentation please refer to [this document](https://www.adobe.io/apis/cloudplatform/dataservices/api-reference.html).

---

## Prerequisites

Follow this [Tutorial](../../authenticate_to_acp_tutorial/authenticate_to_acp_tutorial.md) for authorization to start making API calls.

From the tutorial you should now have the following values:

* `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`: Your specific bearer token value provided after authentication.
* `{IMS_ORG}`: Your IMS org credentials found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.
* `{API_KEY}`: Your specific API key value found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.

* Link to a Docker image of an intelligent service

---

## API workflow

We will be consuming the APIs to create an Experiment Run for training and scoring. For this tutorial, we will be focused on Recipes, Instances, and Experiments. The following chart outlines the relationship between the three and also introduces the idea of a trained model.

### Create a Recipe

With the Docker image for the Recipe created in the [Package Recipe to Data Science Workspace tutorial](../package_recipe_to_import_into_dsw/package_recipe_to_import_into_dsw.md), we can create a Recipe. The Recipe is an umbrella entity holding all Instances. A Recipe is usually tied to one or more Docker images which is specified in the body of the request.

> **Note:** The term "Recipe" and "Engine" (as seen in the API documentation) are interchangeably used and refer to the same thing.

```

`{RECIPE_ID}`: This ID representing the Recipe the Instance is created under.  
`{INSTANCE_ID}`: The ID that represents the Instance.

### Create an Experiment

An Experiment is used by a data scientist to arrive at a high performing model while training. Multiple Experiments include changing datasets, features, learning parameters, and hardware. The following is an example of creating an Experiment.

#### Request <!-- omit in toc -->

```SHELL
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/sensei/experiments \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.adobe.platform.sensei+json;profile=experiment.v1.json' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY' \
  -d `{JSON PAYLOAD}`
```

`{IMS_ORG}`: Your IMS org credentials found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.  
`{ACCESS_TOKEN}`: Your specific bearer token value provided after authentication.  
`{API_KEY}`: Your specific API key value found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.  
`{JSON_PAYLOAD}`: Experiment object that is created. The example we use in our tutorial is shown here:

```JSON
{
    "name": "Experiment for Retail ",
    "mlInstanceId": "{INSTANCE_ID}",
    "tags": {
        "test": "guide"
    }
}
```

`{INSTANCE_ID}`: The ID that represents the Instance.

The response from the Experiment creation looks like this.

#### Response <!-- omit in toc -->

```JSON
{
    "id": "{EXPERIMENT_ID}",
    "name": "Experiment for Retail",
    "mlInstanceId": "{INSTANCE_ID}",
    "created": "2018-01-01T11:11:11.111Z",
    "updated": "2018-01-01T11:11:11.111Z",
    "deleted": false,
    "tags": {
        "test": "guide"
    }
}
```

`{EXPERIMENT_ID}`: The ID that represents the Experiment you have just created.
`{INSTANCE_ID}`: The ID that represents the Instance.

#### Create a scheduled Experiment for training

Scheduled Experiments are used so that we do not need to create each single Experiment Runs via an API call. Instead, we provide all necessary parameters during Experiment creation and each run will be created periodically.  

To indicate the creation of a scheduled Experiment, we must add a `template` section in the body of the request. In `template`, all necessary parameters for scheduling runs are included such as `tasks`, which indicate what action, and `schedule`, which indicates the timing of the scheduled runs.

##### Request <!-- omit in toc -->

```Shell
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/sensei/experiments \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.adobe.platform.sensei+json;profile=experiment.v1.json' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -d '{JSON_PAYLOAD}`

```

`{IMS_ORG}`: Your IMS org credentials found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.  
`{ACCESS_TOKEN}`: Your specific bearer token value provided after authentication.  
`{API_KEY}`: Your specific API key value found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.  
`{JSON_PAYLOAD}`: Data set to be posted. The example we use in our tutorial is shown here:

```JSON
{
    "name": "Experiment for Retail",
    "mlInstanceId": "{INSTANCE_ID}",
    "template": {
        "tasks": [{
            "name": "train",
            "parameters": [
                   {
                        "value": "1000",
                        "key": "numFeatures"
                    }
            ],
            "specification": {
                "type": "SparkTaskSpec",
                "executorCores": 5,
                "numExecutors": 5
            }
        }],
        "schedule": {
            "cron": "*/20 * * * *",
            "startTime": "2018-11-11",
            "endTime": "2019-11-11"
        }
    }
}
```

When we create an Experiment, the body, `{JSON_PAYLOAD}`, should contain either the `mlInstanceId` or the `mlInstanceQuery` parameter. In this example, a scheduled Experiment will invoke a run every 20 minutes, set in the `cron` parameter, starting from the `startTime` until the `endTime`.

##### Response <!-- omit in toc -->

```JSON

    "id": "{EXPERIMENT_ID}",
    "name": "Experiment for Retail",
    "mlInstanceId": "{INSTANCE_ID}",
    "created": "2018-11-11T11:11:11.111Z",
    "updated": "2018-11-11T11:11:11.111Z",
    "deleted": false,
    "workflowId": "endid123_0379bc0b_8f7e_4706_bcd9_1a2s3d4f5g_abcdf",
    "template": {
        "tasks": [
            {

                "parameters": [...],
                "specification": {
                    "type": "SparkTaskSpec",

                    "numExecutors": 5
                }
            }
        ],
        "schedule": {
            "cron": "*/20 * * * *",
            "startTime": "2018-07-04",
            "endTime": "2018-07-06"
        }
    }
}
```

`{EXPERIMENT_ID}`: The ID that represents the Experiment.  
`{INSTANCE_ID}`: The ID that represents the Instance.  


#### Create a scheduled Experiment for scoring

Similar to scheduled Experiments for training, creating a scheduled Experiment for scoring is also done by including a `template` section to the body parameter. Additionally, the `name` field under `tasks` in the body is set as `score`.

The following is an example of creating an Experiment that will run every 20 minutes starting from `startTime` and will run until `endTime`.

            "parameters": [
                {
                    "key": "modelId",
                    "value": "{MODEL_ID}"
                }
            ],
            "specification": {
                "type": "SparkTaskSpec",
                "executorCores": 5,
                "numExecutors": 5
            }
        }],
        "schedule": {
            "cron": "*/20 * * * *",
            "startTime": "2018-07-04",
            "endTime": "2018-07-06"

##### Retrieve the trained Model

In order to get the trained Model created above during training, we make the following request:

##### Request <!-- omit in toc -->

```Shell
curl -X GET \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/sensei/models/?property=experimentRunId=={EXPERIMENT_RUN_ID}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}'

`{ACCESS_TOKEN}`: Your specific bearer token value provided after authentication.  
`{IMS_ORG}`: Your IMS org credentials found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.  

The response represents the trained Model that was created.

##### Response <!-- omit in toc -->

```JSON
{
    "children": [
        {
            "id": "{MODEL_ID}",
            "name": "Tutorial trained Model",
            "experimentId": "{EXPERIMENT_ID}",
            "experimentRunId": "{EXPERIMENT_RUN_ID}",

```

`{MODEL_ID}`: The ID corresponding to the Model.  
`{EXPERIMENT_ID}`:  The ID corresponding to the Experiment the Experiment Run is under.  
`{EXPERIMENT_RUN_ID}`: The ID corresponding to the Experiment Run.  


### Create an Experiment Run for scoring

Now with the trained model, we can create an Experiment Run for scoring. The value of the `modelId` parameter is the `id` parameter returned in the GET Model request above.

#### Request <!-- omit in toc -->

```Shell
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/sensei/experiments/{EXPERIMENT_ID}/runs \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.adobe.platform.sensei+json;profile=experimentRun.v1.json' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -d '{JSON_PAYLOAD}'
```

`{IMS_ORG}`: Your IMS org credentials found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.  
`{ACCESS_TOKEN}`: Your specific bearer token value provided after authentication.  
`{API_KEY}`: Your specific API key value found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.  
`{EXPERIMENT_ID}`: The ID corresponding to the Experiment you want to target. This can be found in the response when creating your Experiment.  
`{JSON_PAYLOAD}`: Data to be posted. The example we use in our tutorial is here:

```JSON
{
   "mode":"score",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "name": "score",
            "parameters": [
                {
                    "key": "modelId",
                    "value": "{MODEL_ID}"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

`{MODEL_ID}`: The ID corresponding to the Model.  

The response from the Experiment Run creation is shown below:

#### Response <!-- omit in toc -->

```JSON
{
    "id": "{EXPERIMENT_RUN_ID}",
    "mode": "score",
    "experimentId": "{EXPERIMENT_ID}",
    "created": "2018-01-01T11:11:11.011Z",
    "updated": "2018-01-01T11:11:11.011Z",
    "deleted": false,
    "tasks": [
        {
            "name": "score",
            "parameters": [...]
        }
    ]
}
```

`{EXPERIMENT_ID}`:  The ID corresponding to the Experiment the Run is under.  
`{EXPERIMENT_RUN_ID}`: The ID corresponding to the Experiment Run you just created.  


#### Retrieve an Experiment Run status for scheduled Experiment Run

To get Experiment Runs for scheduled Experiments, the query is shown below:

##### Request <!-- omit in toc -->

```Shell
curl -X GET \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/sensei/experiments/{EXPERIMENT_ID}/runs' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}'
```

`{EXPERIMENT_ID}`:  The ID corresponding to the Experiment the Run is under.  
`{ACCESS_TOKEN}`: Your specific bearer token value provided after authentication.  
`{IMS_ORG}`: Your IMS org credentials found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.  

Since there are multiple Experiment Runs for a specific Experiment, the response returned will have an array of Run IDs.

##### Response <!-- omit in toc -->

```JSON
{
    "children": [
        {
            "id": "{EXPERIMENT_RUN_ID}",
            "experimentId": "{EXPERIMENT_ID}",
            "created": "2018-01-01T11:11:11.011Z",
            "updated": "2018-01-01T11:11:11.011Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "{EXPERIMENT_RUN_ID}",
            "experimentId": "{EXPERIMENT_ID}",
            "created": "2018-01-01T11:11:11.011Z",
            "updated": "2018-01-01T11:11:11.011Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

`{EXPERIMENT_RUN_ID}`: The ID corresponding to the Experiment Run.  
`{EXPERIMENT_ID}`:  The ID corresponding to the Experiment the Run is under.  

### Stop and delete a scheduled Experiment

If you want to stop execution of a scheduled Experiment before its `endTime`, this can be done by querying a DELETE request to the `{EXPERIMENT_ID}`

#### Request <!-- omit in toc -->

```Shell
curl -X DELETE \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/sensei/experiments/{EXPERIMENT_ID}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}'
```

`{EXPERIMENT_ID}`:  The ID corresponding to the Experiment.  
`{ACCESS_TOKEN}`: Your specific bearer token value provided after authentication.  
`{IMS_ORG}`: Your IMS org credentials found in your unique Adobe Experience Platform integration.  

> **Note:** The API call will disable creation of new Experiment runs. However, it will not stop execution of already running Experiment Runs.

The following is the Response notifying that the Experiment is successfully deleted.

#### Response <!-- omit in toc -->

```JSON
{
    "title": "Success",
    "status": 200,
    "detail": "Experiment successfully deleted"
}
```

## Next steps

This tutorial went over how to consume the APIs to create a Recipe, an Experiment, scheduled Experiment Runs, and trained Models. In the [next exercise](../how_to_score_with_recipe/how_to_score_with_recipe.md), you will be making predictions by scoring a new dataset using the top performing trained model.
