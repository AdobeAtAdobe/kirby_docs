# Connect to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 using the Flow Service API

Flow Service is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the Flow Service API to walk you through the steps to connect Experience Platform to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (hereinafter referred to as "ADLS Gen2"), including showing you how to:

*   [Look up connection specifications](#look-up-connection-specifications)
*   [Create a base connection](#create-a-base-connection)

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Sources](../../../../technical_overview/acp_connectors_overview/acp-connectors-overview.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
*   [Sandboxes](../../../../technical_overview/sandboxes/sandboxes-overview.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully create an ADLS Gen2 source connector using the Flow Service API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for the Flow Service to connect to ADLS Gen2, you must provide values for the following connection properties:

* `url`: The address URL.
* `servicePrincipalId`: The application's client ID.
* `servicePrincipalKey`: The application's key.
* `tenant`: The tenant information that contains your application.

For more information about these values, refer to [this ADLS Gen2 document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-data-lake-storage).

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../technical_overview/platform_faq_and_troubleshooting/platform_faq_and_troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to Platform APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](../../authenticate_to_acp_tutorial/authenticate_to_acp_tutorial.md). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

*   Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
*   x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
*   x-gw-ims-org-id: `{IMS_ORG}`

All resources in Experience Platform, including those belonging to the Flow Service, are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

*   x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

*   Content-Type: application/json

## Look up connection specifications

Before connecting Platform to ADLS Gen2, you must verify that connection specifications exist for ADLS Gen2. If connection specifications do not exist then a connection cannot be made.

Each available source has its own unique set of connection specifications for describing connector properties such as authentication requirements. You can look up connection specifications for ADLS Gen2 by performing a GET request and using query parameters.

#### API format

Sending a GET request without query parameters will return connection specifications for all available sources. You can include the query `property=name=="adls-gen2"` to obtain information specifically for ADLS Gen2.

```http
GET /connectionSpecs
GET /connectionSpecs?property=name=="adls-gen2"
```

#### Request

The following request retrieves the connection specifications for ADLS Gen2.

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connectionSpecs?property=name=="adls-gen2"' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

#### Response

A successful response returns the connection specifications for ADLS Gen2, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required in the next step to create a base connection.

                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Create a base connection

A base connection specifies a source and contains your credentials for that source. Only one base connection is required per ADLS Gen2 account as it can be used to create multiple source connectors to bring in different data.

#### API Format

```http
POST /connections
```

#### Request

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'http://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "adls-gen2",
        "description": "base connection for adls-gen2",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Basic Authentication for adls-gen2",
            "params": {
                "url": "my-url"
                "servicePrincipalId": "my-servicePrincipalId",
                "servicePrincipalKey": "my-servicePrincipalKey",
                "tenant": "my-tenant",
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "0ed90a81-07f4-4586-8190-b40eccef1c5a",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

* `auth.params.url`: The ADLS-Gen2 URL.
* `auth.params.servicePrincipalId`: The ADLS-Gen2 service principal ID.
* `auth.params.servicePrincipalkey`: The ADLS-Gen2 service principal key.
* `auth.params.tenant`: The ADLS-Gen2 tenant information.
* `connectionSpec.id`: The ADLS-Gen2 connection specification.

#### Response

A successful response returns details of the newly created base connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your cloud storage in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "7497ad71-6d32-4973-97ad-716d32797304",
    "etag": "\"23005f80-0000-0200-0000-5e1d00a20000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an ADLS Gen2 base connection using APIs and a unique ID was obtained as part of the response body. You can use this base connection ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to [explore cloud storages using the Flow Service API](./explore-cloud-storage-api-tutorial.md).
