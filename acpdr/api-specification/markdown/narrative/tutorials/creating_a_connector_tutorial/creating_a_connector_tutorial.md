# Setting up Connectors for Adobe Experience Platform

Each Adobe Experience Platform connector has its own guide. For specific information to set up a CRM or cloud-based storage connector, select from the following guides:

**Cloud-based Storage connectors**

* [Azure Blob Connector](ACP_azure_blob_connector_tutorial.md)
* [Amazon S3 Connector](ACP_s3_connector_tutorial.md)

**CRM connectors**

* [Microsoft Dynamics Connector](ACP_dynamic_connector_tutorial.md) 
* [Salesforce Connector](ACP_salesforce_connector_tutorial.md) 

All connector types use the APIs in the connector tutorials, allowing you to ingest data, structure the data, and use the ingested data across the platform. See [Overview for Adobe Experience Platform Connectors](../../technical_overview/acp_connectors_overview/acp-connectors-overview.md) for additional information.

**Set up an Adobe I/O account**.

Before using Adobe Experience Platform Connector APIs, you must set up an account. See [authenticating and accessing APIs](../authenticate_to_acp_tutorial/authenticate_to_acp_tutorial.md) to create an access token used to authenticate API calls from Adobe I/O.
