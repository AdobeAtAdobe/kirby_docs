# Catalog Service RESTful API Resource.


<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview
Catalog service API for client registration. Administrative use only.
Notes:
* When trying out the APIs, get your tokens from IMS stage and prefix it with 'Bearer'.
* All requests with a payload in the request body (i.e., POST, PUT, and PATCH calls) must include the header 'Content-Type: application/json'.  This UI automatically supplies that header when using the 'Try it out' button, but calling clients must take care to supply it for themselves.
